As the slave of God, Isaiah prophesied concerning the Lord Jesus:
- He was God's choice and delight
- He grew up as a tender plant out of dry ground, indicating his lowly status
- Having no beauty that we would desire Him, despised and rejected of men, a man of sorrows
- His visage was marred more than any man. We shouldn't think His appearance was beautiful
- He was despised by man
- He back his back and cheek to those who struck Him
- He didn't cry or lift up His voice
- He didn't quench smoking flax or break a bruised reed
- He had the tongue of an instructed One
- He trusted in God and set His face like a flint
- He bore our griefs and carried our sorrows
