# Message Four - Living in the Kingdom of God as the Realm of the Divine Species

John 1:11-12

> He came to His own

Who is the he?

> Yet those who were His own did not receive Him. But as many as received Him, to them He gave the authority to become children of God.

This is quite interesting. Verse 4, 

> In Him was the life and the life was the light of men and the light shines in the darkness and the darkness did not overcome it.

In Him was life. The life was the light of men. The light is shining in the darkness. The darkness did not overcome it and never will.

Verse 6

> There was a man from God whose name was John, he came for a testimony concerning the light that all might believe through him.

8

> He (John) was not the light, but came that he might testify concerning the light.

9

> This was the true light, which, coming into the world, enlightened every man.

The One who came into the world, the Word becoming flesh, this is the true light, coming into the world

10

> He (the true light) was in the world, and the world came into being through Him (the true light), yet the world did not know him

11

> He (the true light) came to His own but they did not receive Him (the true light) but as many as receive Him (the true light) He gave the authority to become children of God, to those who believe into His name.

Specifically, this is the true light. This one spoke in other places about light.

8:12

> Again therefore Jesus spoke to them saying, I am the light of the world, He who follows Me shall by no means walk in darkness but shall have the light of life.

We have this. We received the true light. We received Christ the Person who is the life.

9:5

> While I am in the world I am the light of the world

In Matt. 5, the Lord said, *you* are the light of the world. Then who is the light of the world? The Lord? Or we, the children of God. The answer is yes. The true light came inot the world. The true light is Christ Himself. He is the light of the world. He is the life with light. Then 12:35-36

> Jesus then said to them, the light is still among you a little while. Walk while you have the light so that darkness may not overcome you. And he who walks in the darkness does not know where he is going. While you have the light, believe into the light so that you may become sons of light.

You are all sons of light. The reproduction of Christ the light of life.

46

> I have come as a light into the world and everyone who believes into me would not remain in darkness.

Now I look back to that moment in time when I believed into His name and I received Him and was born of God. I didn't realise that I was receiving the true light, the light of life. Now all of us were darkness, now we are life in the world, walk as children of light, you are sons of light. So this is the connection between messages 3 and 4. The title of msg 4 is living in the kingdom of God as the realm of the divine species.

The emphasis here isn't the ruling or reigning of God. We don't neglect that. But if you were to come to California you would realise you are under the government of the US, but you don't walk around thinking government all the time. But that's not all that there is. So we want to emphasise, now that we're in the kingdom of God, we need to realise we are in a realm of the divine species.

How to explain more about this realm? Something actual and practical happening in the US every day. People are trying to get into the US through central America and Mexico. They just want to be here. I can't say I understand their thinking very much. But they have been living in a certain realm. For some of them it's almost impossible. We are aware of a married couple. He is from Ukraine. How they got to be able to enter this country is a kind of mystery. There is a yearning in 10s of 1000s of people wanting to come in. They somehow believe its a better life here. I can get a better job even if its just physical labour. So realm means a lot.

Two other theoretical illustrations. Let's say a married couple in NZ gave birth to twins. Twin daughters. For some reason one of the daughters stayed in NZ, the other one somehow ended up in Saudi Arabia. Or in North Korea. ...

Paul was trying to satisfy God's law and he was just condemning himself. Then he said in anyone is in Christ there is no condemnation. Just be being in Christ we are in another realm. In Romans 11. Two trees, a wild olive tree and a cultivated olive tree. The branch was cut off from the wild olive tree and grafted into a cultivated tree. It's still a wild branch but now part of a different kind of tree. Where we are outwardly is unavoidable, but we need to consider inwardly, what realm am I living in? Inwardly, subjectively, living in what realm. 

Let's suppose there was on the earth a country, that once you qualify to enter in, all your needs are met to the fullest extent. So now you're here. The climate is perfect. There is no crime here. Nothing illegal here. Everything here is yours. Your dwelling place. All the food. Just go and select it. You have complete medical care. No cost. Well, who would not want to be in that kind of realm?

The realm of the divine species. I don't know biology. It's a certain category of a living thing. The kingdom of God is a realm of the divine species. Not just of God but of the divine species. What do we mean by divine species. Those people, who have believed into the Son of God, have testified God raised Him from the dead. They have been saved, regenerated. They are a different kind of human being now. They are not the same as the kind of human beings God created in the beginning, not the sinful fallen human beings. They are God-men. Outwardly they seem the same as everybody else. No difference. But in fact, there's a radical difference. That is, they were born of God to have the life and nature of God, to become God in life and nature, but not in the Godhead. My daughter and sons, are they not human? Obviously? So they have their father's life and nature. But not my fatherhood. So the same applies to us. We need intense light to break through in us. To save us from holding on to a doctrine. It may not be real to us very much. We are a different species. Because we have believed in the Lord, we have been born of water and the spirit, we have been born of God, we are in the family of God, we are the same species as the God-man Jesus.

In section 2, 25 verses describing different aspects of this realm of the divine species. Here are some. The whole atmosphere is love. Pure love. Without any bias. Everything is real. Everything is genuine, truthful. There is no sin, no death, no darkness. No sorrow. There is no fear, no anxiety. There is just the most healthy food there is, the atmosphere is altogether wonderful. Everyone is genuine, everyone is pure. This is the realm of the divine kingdom. This is the nature of it. Whatever God is, is in this realm. We do not have the attributes of God like omnipotence. We will never be omniscient. No, only God. Not omnipresent. No God in the Godhead. But you are the same as God your Father. That's why we call Him Father. You are in the realm of the divine species. We may not even realise it. Another realm another kind of being.

Now throughout the US, do you know what they teach in school starting from kindergarten. It doesn't matter how you were born. You can decide on your gender. You can be one or the other or both or many other variations. Some now make an issue about the pronouns you use. I just wonder what would happen if I met someone like this. I kind of hope it would happen. And they ask me, I'm a multigender person so refer to me as they. Please respect me. I would say, now it's my turn. I'm also am of a different species. So I want you to address me as God-man Ron. I am God-man Ron. That is my species, that is my gender. I'm the same as God in life and nature. I am a God-man. So let's just be fair. I will honour your view of yourself. You are this multi-gender person. Now I want you to recognise me as God-man Ron. Or if you want to be formal, God-man Kangas. It's more and more clear to me, that I am a God-man. Whenever I remember it, every negative thing stops immediately. I'm still under training, I don't deny that. But when I'm reminded somehow by the indwelling Spirit. Let all these other drivers drive how they want. You're a God-man. Drive like one. It's not a theory. This is what we are. We are another species. Now, I don't advise you to go back to work with a sign on your chest, I am a God-man. The time will come, when we are transfigured and have a glorified body. 

How many saints really realise what they are, by regeneration. Because we are this species we are living in another realm inwardly while we are living outwardly and physically in this realm on earth. I mentioned previously about two men in the field, two women working, one raptured and one not. The ones who were rapturable had experience the diving of soul and spirit and were living in two different realms at the same time. Inwardly they were in another realm. This other realm is the realm of the divine species. There is something mysterious, paradoxical, that the more we are matured in the divine life, the more we become the same as God in life and nature, the more Jesusly human we become. We're a God-man. The man part is the Jesusly human part. Many trainees were born after brother Lee went to be with the Lord and ask me, what was he like. I just am fond of telling them, he was the most human person I've ever known. I hope it's okay, I want to tell you a story related to his humanity.

In 1968 140 of us went to Taiwan then to Philippines and Japan. On one Lord's Day afternoon the saints in Taipei wanted to take us to a beautiful beach by the ocean. Before we left Los Angeles we were told repeatedly by one of the elders, we are not worldly. We are not going to Taiwan for anything worldly. To buy stuff that's worldly. I was talking about buying something (a bag of seashells). But I didn't buy it. Then I can close my eyes and still see. I'm walking behind brother Lee but he's not moving his arms much, because in each hands he has two bags of sea shells. I thought about that. Surely brother Lee is not worldly. And I was moving in the direction of becoming religiously inhuman. I had to be saved. The reason I tell you this is not just to make thing pleasant. To realise the mystery. We are of the divine species, but we are Jesusly human. He's our meal offering. To become Jesusly human by feeding on Him as the meal offering. So as the divine species we are God-men. God became man. There's a burden to know the kind of people we are. We've been born of God. We're partakers of the nature of God. All He is and has accomplished is here for our experience personally and corporately.
