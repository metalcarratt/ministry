# Entering into Christ's wonderful shepherding in His heavenly ministry to shepherd the church of God as a slave of God for the fulfillment of the dream of God

Christ came as a shepherd when He became flesh. After He died and resurrected and became the life-giving Spirit to indwell us He became the pneumatic Shepherd to indwell us as the other comforter. Shepherding our soul and our entire being. In ascension this Christ is still that shepherd there, caring for His churches and for all of His believers and the Father's children. This shepherding work of the Lord will continue into eternity.

The burden of this outline is that we have to endeavour to enter into that shepherding. We are not here to shepherd the church or saints apart from His shepherding. The need is to enter into His shepherding in His heavenly ministry. How does He carry out His shepherding? As a slave. We who want to enter into His shepherding all must take the position of slaves.

All this is for the fulfillment of the dream of God.

## I. We need to enter into Christ's wonderful shepherding in His heavenly ministry by enjoying and ministering Christ to shepherd the church of God as a slave of God for the fulfillment of the dream of God, the eternal purpose of God.

If we are not first shepherded by Him, enjoying His fine detailed living intrinsic shepherding. If we do not enjoy the Lord in this way there is actually no way we can shepherd others. Charges that we should shepherd according to God. Not according to your way or preference or will or interest. According to God. This incarnate, crucified, resurrected God, this God who is now dwelling within us and working and operating within us. This God is the One we should shepherd according to. So the real shepherding is really the Lord shepherding His saints through us. We are just His extension. We are just joined to Him, mingled with Him. When we enjoy His shepherding we shall be able to minister Him and His shepherding to the saints and the churches.

### A. God's dream - a dream of His eternal purpose. God is doing only one thing, building His eternal habitation.

The dream of God is to gain the reality of the house of God, Bethel. This mutual dwelling between God and us. Also our place to live.

### B. He did not come to be served but to serve.

Our service as leading ones. We're here to serve the saints, the flock of God. Reading these sentences something sweet should be touching our heart.

Mark 10:45 the Son of Man came not to be served (we are here not to be served, we should not even expect to be served) but to serve and to give His (soul) life as a ransom for many

Luke 22, Who is greater? The one who reclines at greater or the one who serves? Surely it is the one at the table. But I am the one in your midst as the one who serves.

He took the place of a slave to serve the disciples.

He served when we look back in our lives. Jacob said, He is the God who has shepherded me all my life to this day. Have a quick look back on your life. We can all conclude God has shepherded us. All our life. In big things, in small things, in every way, to this day. We would not be sitting here listening to this world, in the church life, having the privilege to serve Him and His people, if He did not shepherd us all our life until now. He is the good shepherd, the great shepherd of the sheep. He is the chief shepherd of all of us. He is the shepherd and overseer of our souls. This One served us. Served us by His shepherding us.

Even as I am speaking right now He is shepherding me. I cannot give this message if the shepherd is not anointing, leading and guiding me.

He is going to serve us in the future, even forever. The Lamb who is in the midst of the throne will shepherd them and lead them to springs of water of life, and wipe away every tear. Even here I can see the cherishing. From all our dis-satisfaction. For eternity the Lamb will still be shepherding us.

### C. Let Him serve us that we can serve others

More than anything else we need to be shepherded by Him. The first thing is not that we serve Him or the church. The first thing, in principle, is to let Him serve us, minister to us. Shepherd and guide us. He can serve others through us. As we are being shepherding us He can shepherd others through us. Firstly into us, so that we can become the channel, all the leading ones who are shepherds of God's flock. They are channels for Him to dispense Himself as life into others. The primary thing is not fighting fires, solving problems, completing and carrying out affairs. The main point is to minister Christ as life into others. Especially in the church life He needs the elders, the leading ones, the responsible ones. We still think to shepherd is to give advice or fellowship. That's not wrong but its not intrinsic enough. What about one that doesn't appear to have a need? All the saints need Christ, more Christ as life. Someone has to be one with the chief shepherd to do that. That responsibility falls on us. Lord, I do not know how to shepherd. I may shepherd in the wrong way. Some of us regret out so-called shepherding. Let us have a renewal in this service of the church, to shepherd the saints by ministering life. Take the lead first to experience Him. Let Him wash our feet. Let Him wipe out feet. Let Him cherish and nourish us. Then spontaneously, in a right way, we will do the same, as if He is doing it.

### D. Preparation for eternity

We are here under training, learning. The slave was under training. Because He was faithful the master set him over many things. "And His slaves will serve Him." I spoke about this phrase a lot. In eternity, in the NJ, His slaves will serve Him. This is one of the eternal blessings of the NJ that we can still serve Him in eternity. Today let us strive to be those faithful slaves so that in the coming age and in eternity we will be ready to continue this service.

Our usefulness is the result of our being mingled with Him. We need to be mingled with this heavenly shepherd. Our usefulness will be seen by our being mingled with Him. We need to spend time with Him to be mingled with this good shepherd. The degree of the mingling in us is the degree of our usefulness to Him. How can my usefulness grow? Only by being mingled with Him more and more.

### E. 

The real stewardship, or the real dispensing work is the fulness of a shepherding service. Shepherding is a dispensing work. Dispensing the mysteries of God and the varied grace of God. This is what we're doing in the church. This is why we are elders and responsible brothers.

## II. To shepherd the flock of God is to watch over the souls of the saints, being one with the Lord as the Shepherd and Overseer of their souls in His care for the welfare of their inner being and in HIs exercising His oversight over the condition of their real person.

All our problems are more in the realm of our soul. That's where all the trouble is, the problems, the sicknesses. The souls of the saints need to be watched over by the shepherds. To be one with the Lord as the shepherd, we need to be the overseer of the saints' souls. We need to pray for the souls of the saints. The welfare, the health of their inner being. The real person is the inner man. How tender this is. How thorough this is. How detailed this is. How inward this is. How much we need to be like Christ. How much we need to follow His example. How much we need our souls to be watched over by Him. How much we need the restoration of our souls first. I am utterly short of this but thank the Lord for this reminder.

### A. Elders must enjoy the Lord as grace and truth to dispense it

We may be elders, we may have a position, we may even have a burden. But somehow we are lacking this one thing - daily time in HIs presence to receive from Him. The receive His all-inclusive shepherding ourselves. I feel these days we need to fight for time. Less time on so many things occupying us, more time in His presence.

### B. Elders need to buy the oil to pay the price for the truth, the white garment, eye-salve to heal their blindness

Laodicea said they are rich, not knowing their wretched condition. They needed to buy, which is to pay the price. The virgins failed to fill the vessels. The buying age is still here. We can pay the price and gain the oil, the spirit the truth, the gold, the garment, the eye-salve. All of this for our healing, for our living, for our enrichment. All of these things we need to buy. What do we shepherd the saints with if we are in poverty ourselves, blind ourselves. We have nothing to offer them. Everyday, let us buy.

### C. Taking care of the Lord's possession and investing their spiritual gift

Exercising what the Lord has measured out to us, given to us, which are just the Lord's possessions. The sinners, believers, churches. How do we take care of them? Investing our spiritual gift, in the form of food to God's people. A healthy normal local church should not be poor in the word of God. Certain elders should give themselves to labour on the word and teaching. If we do not take the time to be in the word, or only in a minimal way, barely enough for us to survive, we don't have the abundance, the surplus, to minister to the people of God. We need to be faithful to come to the Word on a daily basis. So many things are distracting us, fighting for our time. We actually have the time, we just need to redeem them and not waste them. Something timely that this or that saint needs, that the church needs.

## III. The elders should not lord if over God's flock, which is God's possession; the churches are God's possession, allotted to the elders as their portion, entrusted to them by God for their care.

A good shepherd does not lord it over the sheep. This is God's flock, not yours or mine. Who are we to lord over God's property. These are the saint just entrusted to us temporarily for our care. We don't own them .They are not our possession.

### A. Only Christ is our Lord, our Master

We are all brothers. But you, don't be called Rabbi. None of us is the Lord. None of us is the master. We are not the Lord. We are just brothers, like all the saints. We're placed in a place of responsibility. Not to be the lord, but simply to be one of the brothers to take care of the others.

### B. Elders can take the leadership but not the lordship

The first job, the first rule for a proper leader or elder, is to be a pattern Not to do this or do that. The first thing is to be, to be an example, to be a pattern. Shepherding the church is also a pattern so all the saints can shepherd one another. The Lord said He has set Himself as a pattern. You need to also serve by example. When we require the saints to do this or do that, the first things is, am I doing it? A lot of times when we are forced to answer that question we cannot answer that.

### C. Do not direct the saints where to live, what to do, where to go without directing them to pray

Sometimes we just say something. We become negligent. Even directing them. We need to be careful. We need to honour the Lord as the Head of the Body. Any decision you make for someone else is an insult to the Head of the Body. What a strong word, insulting the Lord's headship, when we make the decision for someone. We at best can say, brother go to pray, let the Lord lead you. I may have some feeling but I'm not the Lord. Seek His guidance, He is the Lord, not me. I may have more experience, more learning, but I am still not the Lord.

These days we have a burden for migration. But we pray, we hope, that those who have migrated because they have the assurance the Lord sent them to this city or that, that they have brought the matter to the Lord in prayer, and that they have clarity it is the Lord's leading. If not it is better to wait until they have the Lord's leading. Otherwise we won't have the faith that the Lord has sent us. We all need to have that assurance that the Lord is in it and has sent us.

### D. We also need to check if the feeling we have is according to the feeling of the Body.

### E. careful directing saints in their marriage

The older ones need to be careful about directing and even worse controlling the young saints. Have these things happened? Yes, sometimes with quite disastrous results. We can give them sound guidance, some learning. the commandments of the scripture. But we must be careful always to not tell them what to do but to look to the Lord's leading. We don't know. Who are we to know? We can only see something rather outward. We can't see into the future. We can't see the inner being. This is really not a safe thing to do.

We have to help them in morality, in life, in human living, in taking care of the future, concerning their parents, and praying and seeing the Lord. Marriage is a very serious thing. This is a lifelong relationship. It is something ordained by God. How much the church life depends on healthy marriages and families. Let us be really careful in this matter.

## IV. We need to take care of the saints in everything and in every way for the dispensing of Christ into them

### A. Contact the saints

Every contact with others in the church must be an opportunity to minister Christ to them. The most important job of an elder is not to arrange things, organise things. The first work is to contact people. To contact the saints. Not just those who are needy as we perceive them to be, but some who apparently are not needy. All kinds of saints. Saints in all kinds of conditions. Visit them, invite them. Sometimes a short period of time. Before a meeting, after a meeting, a meal, coffee or tea. Just to find out how they are doing. Just to minister something of the Lord into them. A church like that will be a healthy church.

### B. Enjoy Christ as the sin offering

The priests eat the sin offering. The rich enjoyment of Christ as the sin offering enables us to minister Christ that deals with sin to restore their broken fellowship with God. They are sinful, they need help and restoration into fellowship with the Lord. Who can help them? Some that can minister Christ as that sin dealing life. In gentleness and meekness of spirit. This is an area for us to learn much.

Exortation - helping them in something, admonishing in something. In all of this we have to trust the Lord in these things. To touch their heart, not to scold them, not to rebuke. Learn not to rebuke the saints, no matter how bad the situation may be, no matter how hard their hard, rebellious they are. We should have the spirit of meekness to restore. We do not need to mention their weakness or sin. The life of Christ ministered will heal them. To enlighten, convict, even heal them. All we can do is minister life. Not mention the weakness the fault and so forth.

Nothing tries our patience than to care for and shepherd the saints. If we can recover a fallen one over a long period of time that will be a great thing.

## V. In their fellowship with one another the elders need to be restricted in their speaking

A. Uncovering brings in a curse.

## VI. The organic maintenance of the golden lampstand is Christ's heavenly ministry to cherish the churches in His humanity and nourish the churches in His divinity to produce the overcomers through His organic shepherding

The son of man walking in the midst of the churches is the one who wrote the epistles to the churches, calling overcomers. This work is the work of Christ's organic shepherding today. This top shepherding is to produce overcomers in this age, to fulfil God's purpose today.

## VII. The goal of Christ's wonderful shepherding in HIs heavenly minister is to build up the New Jerusalem for the accomplishment of the eternal economy of God; for eternity we will enjoy the Lamb, who is tin the midst of the throne, shepherding us and continually guiding us to springs of waters of life.

In eternity this Lamb will still be our eternal shepherd. Guiding us to those springs of waters of life. Thank the Lord for His wonderful shepherding in His heavenly ministry.
