# Message 3 - the need to develop our faith in the Lord and our love for Him



The need here is for the developing of faith and love. We do have faith. We have believed in the Lord. But this faith needs to grow. It needs to be cultivated more. We are all sitting here today, this is a sign that we all love the Lord. But this love needs to grow, be perfected, completed.

2 Thes. 1:3, because your faith grows exceedingly and the love of each one of you all to one another is increasing

This is very fresh to me. The faith that we have, Paul got the report from Timothy, that that faith in the saints had been growing, even growing exceedingly. And the love they had to the Lord and toward each other was increasing. That pleased, encouraged, comforted the apostle. 

These two don't grow alone, separately; they grow together.

We are not born with faith. This faith is a gift given to us. This faith that has come into us, He it's author, the One who inaugurated it. But He is also the perfecter. Of course faith from God is perfect. So what does it mean to perfect it? It means to complete, to finish it. The author, perfecter of *our* faith. It needs not only a beginning, but an ending.

1 John 2:5, 4:12, 17-18

This love we have received from God is God Himself. The essence of God is love itself. He is love is perfected in us. His love is perfect. But it needs to be perfected, completed in us. It needs to be manifested in a full way. When it is manifested through in us in a full way, this love is perfected in us. Perfect love casts out fear. Love itself is perfect as it's essence is God. Perfect love is the love perfected in us. Those who fear have not been perfected in love. He has this love but has not been perfected in this love. This love, in our experience, also needs to grow, to advance, to be completed, to be perfected.

Titus 3:15, greet those who love us in faith. Grace be with you.

Love, faith, and grace. Our emphasis today is on love and faith. The epistle to Titus concludes with a wonderful faith and a super excellent love. Paul said grace super abounded with faith and love. Paul spoke repeatedly about faith, grace and love. We have super abounding grace. Here we have a wonderful faith and a super excellent love. Not the kind of love the world offers. That love can be humanly generated. This love is the love of God which is super excellent. To be firm and stand against the downward trend of the church, this wonderful faith and super excellent love are indispensable. These are not basic things, they are indispensable. They need to be perfected, to grow, to increase. We should not trust what our eyes can see. If you spend too much time on the internet you will become like a worldly person trusting what you see. We should walk by faith, enjoy the Triune God as the source of this faith. We don't live by what we can see, we substantiate something we can't see by this faith infused into us. God is also the source of this love. We should love Him and all those who belong to Him. Two directions. Loving our God back. This love overflows and love all those who belong to Him. We love the saints. Only in this way can we become the overcomers in the current of the churches degradation.

## I. Develop and perfect our faith in the Lord and our love for Him, the One for whom we have not seen

No matter how long we have been saved. We need to continue to develop and perfect our faith in the Lord and our love for Him.

### A. Having not seen you love, having not seen yet believing you exult with joy unspeakable and full of glory.

I have not seen the Lord with my physical eyes but I love Him. One day we will see Him face to face but not yet. Such a mysterious thing. Not only believe what they have not seen, they love what they have not seen, even some are martyred for someone they have not seen.

In Thessalonians faith and love are considered the breastplate, the constructing elements of the genuine Christian life. The two main things for the breast are faith and love. They become our breastplate in our living, for our protection. These two will become our protection, sustain and maintain and advance our Christian life and Church life. May love and faith grow in all the local churches on the earth.

We love Him whom we have not seen because of the faith infused into us. The hearing of faith. Where does faith come from, practically speaking? From our **hearing the Word of God**. Not from hearing nonsense. How does our faith grow? Where did it start? One day we heard the Word. Through that hearing something is transmitted into us. The response we have when we hear the Word is faith. The seed of faith is sown into our spirit, into our heart. That word causes this kind of response within us. The more we hear the more we believe. We need to spend more time in the word. WE need to read the word, chew the word, praise over the word. muse in the word. Spend much time in the Word. The more we do the more faith would prevail. Don't try to work out faith. Don't try to drum up a power to believe. Just read the Word, just say amen to the promises of God. Faith will just increase in us.

The **result is we exult**. With a joy that is unspeakable. Christ is invisible and this joy is unspeakable. When we love the Lord and enjoy Him we are filled with glory. Some people say the face of every martyr is the face of an angel. They didn't drum up some faith when they were being killed. They were filled with faith, filled with love and so they were filled with joy immersed in glory. That was the face of Stephen.

Why are you not joyful? Something is wrong with your faith, something is wrong with your love. If our faith and our love are normal, the natural result is unspeakable joy full of glory.

### B. Faith avails, operating through love

Living faith is active, and it operates through love. **When we love, faith operates**. Faith will bring us into the love. It's like a cycle here.

By faith we believe into the Lord. By faith we receive the Spirit, the Spirit of love. This faith is full of power. It is not powerless. Faith is filled with power.

Faith operates through love to fulfil God's purpose. How is Sonship completed? At the base is faith, operating in us, through love. Love toward God, love toward man. This is how Sonship is completed.

**Love is related to our appreciation of Christ**. Something you truly appreciate you automatically love. Love is a response out of that faith towards God. Towards Christ. Without such an appreciation faith cannot operate. The more we love, the more we appreciate, the more faith can operate. Let us love the Lord more, day by day.

The hearing of faith awakens our loving appreciation.

The more we love the Lord the more faith operates to bring us into the riches of the all-inclusive Christ.

### C. Peace to the brothers and love with faith from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ

Grace and peace are often paired together. Here we have peace and love with faith. Where does love come from? From the Father. Where does faith come from? The Lord Jesus Christ. The source is the Father God and the Son.

Faith is for receiving the Lord and love is for our enjoying Him. John 1:12 believe into Him by faith we become the children of God. 14 If anyone loves me my Father will come to Him. This is about enjoyment. Enjoying the Trinue God by loving Him.

Faith is a match for our love. A support.

## II. Looking away unto Jesus, the Author and Perfecter of our faith

### A. Faith and love are two inseparable excellent virtues of the believers in Christ

Peter says Him whom we have not seen we love. Paul in Hebrews says looking away unto Jesus. Can we see Him or not? With the inner eyes of the heart. Do we not see Him in our spirit? He is the author and perfecter of your faith. The One who is the originator is the completer. Don't look at yourself. Look to Him. Look away, especially from yourself, look away to Him. He, for sure, will complete our faith.

Unbelief is the most abominable sin to God. That's why Joshua and Caleb entered the good land. They pleased God by their faith, believing God's promise. Today we are the same. Let us not displease the Lord by not believing in Him and His Word.

### B. Faith is for appreciating, substantiating and receiving the unlimited riches of the Triune God

We believe into Him. Into always means joining. It is because of this we are here enjoying this Christ. What is going on here? It is all in the realm of faith. Unbelievers don't understand. We are partaking, participating of Christ in all that He has done. What does it mean you are partaking all these riches. You have to believe, then you can partake.

By believing we identify with Him. What we accomplished, attained, are our accomplishments and attainments. The economy of God which is in the realm of faith.

### C. Love is for experiencing, enjoying and living our the immeasurably rich Triune God.

Let all the churches on the earth be filled with love.

Our love for the Lord must be absolute. Same with faith. The faith must be absolute. To the extend of it's absoluteness. That's how strong our receiving is and our living out and expression is. Let's not love the Lord with reservation, partially. There is not such thing as believing half way. "I believe 50%" It's total. Let our love be the same.

Love Him with the first love, the best love.

Our faith and love is directly proportionate to the quantity and quality of time we spend with Him. We need to fight back and not allow the enemy to rob our time. The result is faith decreasing and love growing cold. In the end time the love grows cold. The opposite should be happening to us. Let us set our heart on the Lord, exercise our spirit toward Him, be absolute with Him, have times in His presence, occupied by Him, lost in Him. In that time we are fully joined with Him in faith. Fully living Him out, expressing Him. May our life and service in the church really have the reality of this growing. Not stagnant but growing, day by day.

## III. The love of God has been poured out in our hearts through the Holy Spirit who has been given to us

Poured out, flooding out hearts, through the Holy Spirit who has been given to us. What shall we do today? It has been poured out. We need to drink. We need to drink this Spirit to be soaked by this Spirit so this Spirit will fill our whole being.

We are more than conquerors by Him who loves us. This love poured out into our hearts makes us more than conquerors.

This love has been poured out, as a once for all thing, but this love is being transmitted into our heart as a continuous experience through our enjoying God.



Eph. 1:4, even as he chose us in Him before the foundation of the world to be holy and without belish 

3:17 christ may make his home in your heart through faith, rooted and grouend in love.

4:2 with all lowliness and meekenss, bearing one another in love

4:15 holding to truth in love we may grow up into him in all things

5:16 all the functioning of the gifts causes the growth of the body unto the building up of itself in love

5:2 walk in love, even as christ also loved us and gave himself for us.



After all these instances of "in love" in Ephesians, Paul concludes with "grace be with all those who love our Lord Jesus Christ in incorruptibilty." What does it mean? We need to lvoe the Lord, not in a wild, selfish or with good intention but in incorruptibility. In this love we can be rooted, grounded, bear one another, hold to truth to be built up together in the body as an organism for the expression fo Chist. we also need to walk and have our being in the divine love. If we love Him in these things we love Him in incorruptibility.

May peace be to all the brothers and love with faith from God the Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ.
