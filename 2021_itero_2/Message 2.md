# Message 2

The main point in this message is that we would do what makes God happy, which is to care for the building up of the Body of Christ, particularly by caring for the functioning of all the one talented ones.



## I.

A.

sanctification of the Spirit unto the obedience of the sprinkling of the blood of Christ - God was seeking you before you got regenerated and doing things in your environment to get you saved. Woman with the broom - signifies the seeking sanctification of the Spirit. 

Genesis - Brooding of the Spirit, speaking of God, God said. Then you have light. As the light Christ is the shining of God. The reality, speaking and shining of God, generates life in the universe. In our experience we experience the seeking Spirit, God spoke something into our being, it was like He was saying let there be light.

Eph. 4:1-16

B.

To build up the church you need all the body, pursuing and growing in life, personally for the building up of the Body collectively. This is what Eph. 4:15-16 says.

C.

There has never been a time in church history like this, where God's people have been under a ministry, the purpose of which is for the building up of the Body of Christ. This is why the Lord raised up brothers Nee and Lee. I'm so thankful brother Nee had the foresight to charge brother Lee to go to Taiwan, and he then came here and from here to the whole globe.

16-17th century. Luther with recovery of justification by faith.

1700s, Moravian brothers. Count Zinzendorf and the Moravian brethren . Also two Wesley brothers raised up - John and Charles Wesley. The house is still there. John Wesley went all over England and had rocks thrown at him. There were riots. He just kept riding on his horse, preaching the gospel. His brother just wrote hymns, hymns that we have in our hymnal. John Wesley made a particular saddle for his horse. This saddle had a book stand at the front of the saddle, so he could put his bible there and read it while riding his horse. John Wesley knew the doctrine of justification by faith. They went to Oxford, they were brilliant young people. But he had not experienced. So one Moravian brother told him. Just preach justification by faith to others until you yourself are assured that you are justified. John Wesley followed and he was assured. These two brothers together with Whitfield began an open air meeting. Before you had to say it in a building with an angled roof. George Whitfield spoke the gospel outdoors to large gatherings. Many people were brought to the Lord in this way. This is the advance of the Lord's recovery.

19th century, a group of brothers raised up in Dublin, Ireland, name as the brethren. Among them was a former Anglican ministry John Nelson Darby who began to expound the bible in a wonderful way. Lee asked Nee what can I read to understand the whole Bible and brother Nee came to his room and dumped on his bed two books, exposition of the bible by Darby and another book. Brother Nee gave him John Nelson Darby's exposition. There were other people like William Calley, C H Macintosh. D L Moody said, if all the books in the world were to be burned I would just request for two to not be burned- the Bible and CH Mackintosh's notes on the Pentateuch. Another brethren writer was George Cutting. Assurance of salvation. Hudson Taylor, a missionary to mainland China. One time we were with brother Lee and I told him, we just got through going over the world situation in God's move. I said that was marvellous. Brother Lee it really amazes me how the Lord sent Hudson to mainland China. Then sent you from mainland China to America. brother Lee laughed. I also said this, I was so touched that Hudson Taylor went to the interior and dressed just like the Chinese dressed at that time and was persecuted by his fellow missionaries for doing that. But he dressed the same way they dressed, because he was like the apostle Paul who became Jew to Jew and Greek to Greek. This is what Hudson Taylor did. brother Lee made this statement, do you know why he could do that? Because he was 100% for Christ. God also raised up George Muller. Lots of experiences of living by faith. Jessie Pen Lewis.

20th century. We have Watchman Nee and brother Witness Lee. IF you read their writings, even if you're just a Christian, I have never seen Christians like this. So absolute, loves the Lord and the Bible so much. Read the collected works, you're just in awe the way the Bible's opened up.

So here we are in this present age. You could say these people are "spiritual giants". But brother Lee and Nee's ministry covers the totality of the NT ministry. The Body of Christ, which brings in the functioning of all the members. There has never been a time like this in church history.

Resumption of Watchman Nee's ministry. "The body testimony being God's final recovery" - we believe that God is recovering them most difficult thing today. Eph. 4. We never had to worry about the fulfillment of John 16. WE are not afraid it will not be fulfilled. Suppose someone is a believer and asks what he should do if he has not received eternal life. we have John 3:16 to share with him. But I have read the NT more than 200 times. I'm not worried about any other passage. I have even read Revelation a few hundred times. However I am worried about Eph. 4. I'm concerned how this passage of the scripture will be fulfilled. The work of the ministry is to arrive at the oneness of the faith, the church is the body of Christ and it builds itself up in love. When I lie on my bed I'm always apprehensive of the fulfillment of Ephesians. I don't have the assurance the condition of Ephesians will be fulfilled in the Church today. When will we be one? The situation is very complicated. How can this chapter be recovered. Yet we believe there will be a day when God's recovery will read the fulfillment of Eph. 4. God is doing recovery work everywhere. The ultimate work may well be this. The Body testimony. (The reality of the body of Christ). 

When brother Lee came to this country he came with the same burden. When the body is built up the building of the body is the preparation of the bride, the kingdom comes, his will is one, we enter into the next age of 1000 years.

In one meeting he shared on the body being the organism of the body of Christ. he said, start editing right here. From then he just started sharing on the body of Christ from so many angles. The purpose of the blending - to usher us into the body of Christ. at the end of his days his ministry was all on bringing in the body testimony. it's a great great thing, where we are today.

D.

Talents - spiritual gifts. Each member of the body has at least one talent. every member has a spiritual gift. Some have five talents with great gifts. Some have two. But most of the members of the body are one talented members. We are being perfected to bring forth our talent, our spiritual gift. If we are faithful to do this, to function according to the measure of what the Lord gives us. When we stand before the judgment seat we want to hear this, good and faithful slave enter into the joy of your master. we want to hear the lord say that to us.

Matt. 25:14-30. The one talented one, instead of investing his talent, "master I knew about you ,you are a hard man, reaping where you did not sow, and I was afraid and went off and hid your talent in the earth. Behold you have what is yours." Firstly he said the lord is a hard man. When I read that I told the Lord you're not a hard man to me. I love you. Your my Lord, King, Husband. You're not a hard man to me. So I would say this, apparently he was a hard man to this person. But look at Exo 21. Lord Jesus as the slave of God. I love my master. I love my wife, I love my children. I will not go out free. Was the Father a hard man to the Lord Jesus when He was ministering on this earth. Eventually the Lord says to this slave, "Evil and slothful slave. you should have deposited my money with the money changers and I would have recovered what is mine with interest." what does it mean to deposit our money? we use the Lord's gift. We all have a gift. It is a lie to say we do not. It is to use the Lord's gift to save people and minister his riches to them. All of us can do that. We need to pray that we would do this. At the end of this parable the lord rewards the others and says to cast out the useless slave to the outer darkness. Saints, we didn't come this way to be cast into outer darkness. Wouldn't that be a tragedy if we came all this way for this result? Lord, do not allow that to happen to any of us. We like to invest our talent by being one with you by saving people and ministering your riches into them. Sometimes we fail or go against the Lord and we don't have the Lord's presence. If I don't have the Lord's presence for a period of time, even if for an hour, I feel like I'm in outer darkness. Light is the presence of God. When you're in light you're in the presence of God. Otherwise you're in darkness. Outer darkness. There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. Weeping indicates regret, gnashing of teeth indicates self blame. Why didn't I speak in the meeting. Why didn't I speak to that person You'll be full of regret and self blame.

"Men always way for Paul's five talents to come along. But we may have to way 400 years for God to give us a great gift." Brother Lee and brother Nee's work is still speaking to us. "there is no one who has less than one talent. IN the church you cannot find anyone who does not have one talent. Today the building up of the church hinges on the one talented ones." If you bring five one talented ones, those five equals one five-talented ones. How many five-talented ones would we have if everyone brought their spiritual gifts? IT would be off the charts. (again from the resumption of watchman Nee's ministry)

In Acts they said about Paul and his co-workers, these are the men who have turned the world upside down. That's what we want to do just by being functioning members of the body.

what is needed - men who can lead others into function . This is the kind of brother brother Lee was. He brought you into your function. He never replaced anyone's function. If he felt they had more of a function, he would bring them into the function of bringing others into their function. This is the NT ministry. 

To be these kind of people we need to be absolute for the Lord. Lev. 1:3-4. Note 1 on each verse. Burnt offering. Christ as the one who is absolute for God and for God's satisfaction. The kind of person we have in us. When the priest laid his hands on the burnt offering they were joined to the offering and became one. In such a union all our weaknesses and faults are taken on by Him and all His attributes become ours. It also signifies Christ in his being the life that enables God's people to have such a living. He enables us to have the same living that He had, a living absolute for God's satisfaction.

F.

Brother lee's testimony in "The History and Revelation of the Lord's Recovery."

Gal 5:25-26, if we live by the spirit let us walk by the spirit. let us not become vainglorious, provoking, envying one another. - if you are really waling by the spirit you will not be vainglorious, won't envy another, no competition. You will be happy with the other saints.

## II. God's good pleasure, God's heart's desire, is what makes God happy

A. creation of the earth - to Job, when I created the earth all the sons of God shouted for joy.

B. creation of man. "God saw that it was good." For the creation of man He said "very good." Man has God's image and dominion for the kingdom of God.

C. incarnation. the God-man Jesus. The angel of the Lord visited the shepherds and told them how happy God was. "The Angel of Lord stood by them, the glory of the Lord shone. I announce to you good news of great joy. Suddenly with the angel a multitude of the heavenly army praising God and saying glory in the highest place and among men." The angels were so thrilled, surely God was happy. 

D. Christ's baptism. When I received the Lord He became real to me. I took a walk, praying an talking to him. I said Lord, I'm just amazed at how real you are. Some Christians said to me, you need to be baptised, I said why the Lord is very real to me. One said to me, even the Lord was baptised, so I said, I'm getting baptised. "This is my son the beloved, in whom I have found my delight." God's delight.

E. Resurrected and glorified Christ. "This is my son the beloved in whom I found my delight. Hear him."

F. the return of the prodigal sons. Luke 15. Can refer to an un-regenerated person, but also a backslidden believer. The parable of a happy father. The father ran. The only time in the Bible it says the father ran. When you make a turn he will run to you. He's your father. Of course he will run to you. I was talking to this one brother who said you can lose your salvation. I said, well once you're born you can't be unborn. It's too late. Here the father ran to his returning son. Let us eat and be merry. Here we see the merriment of God. God is happy.

G. when His Son is revealed in us.

H. to operate in us the willing and working for His good pleasure. This should cause us to check, but are you living a happy life? When I did this outline I had to stop. Lord, what about me? The Christian life with the supply of the Body life is a happy life. When we first came into the church life we were filled with Christ as our happiness. That is normal. We just need to maintain that joy. Our inward joy is an indication we are living and walking according to God's good pleasure. Philippians, written in prison, is a book full of joy and rejoicing. Rejoice in the Lord always, again I say rejoice.

I. To have a man of God who lives God and lives our God.

J. When we eat God as our spiritual food.

K. when we are daily strengthened into our inner man

L. when we remain in our spirit and pay attention to our spirit

M. when we serve him as a slave by living in the reality of the kingdom

N. When we worship Him in spirit

O. one with him in his ministry

P.

Q. God will be happy with our glorification.
