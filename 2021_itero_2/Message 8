# Taking, experiencing, and enjoying Christ as our King, our Lord, our Head and our Husband for the building up of the Body of Christ to consummate the New Jerusalem

## I. We must take, experience, and enjoy Christ as our King

### A.

2 Cor. 1:12, Our boasting is this (just pause there and wonder, what is Paul going to boast about?) the testimony of our conscience, that in singleness and sincerity of God, not in fleshly wisdom, ... and more abundantly toward you.

The way he lived, the way he conducted himself, whether toward people outside or inside the church. He always conducted himself in the grace of God. He was always living in the enjoyment of God.

1 Tim. 3, I want you to know how to conduct yourself in the house of God.

How should we conduct ourselves? In the grace of God. This is the way we need to live and conduct ourselves.

Hymn - nothing between. Lord I don't want there to be anything between you and me. We should always have that aspiration and prayer, that there wouldn't be anything between us and the Lord.

Not only a good conscience but also a pure conscience. Lord, be the goodness of my conscience and be the purity of my conscience.

1 Tim. 1:5, the end (the result) of the charge (not to teach differently but God's economy) is love out of a good conscience.

When we are really, intrinsically in the healthy teaching of God's economy, it stirs up our love for the Lord.

Holding faith and a good conscience, very important during the time of the church's degradation. Deacons need to be those holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience. Single aim, single goal, God Himself, Christ Himself. In this meeting, our goal is to contact God in our spirit That's to have a true heart and maintain a pure conscience.

I thank God whom I serve from my forefathers in a pure conscience.

### B. The throne is the center of the universe and it is the Lord's ruling presence

Lord, everyday, fill me with your ruling presence. The throne in our spirit is actually Christ Himself. In other words the throne is a person. Isa. 22:23, He will become a throne of glory for His Father's house. In this verse Christ is referred to as a throne of glory. He is a throne of glory in our spirit. 

Heb. 4:16, Paul charges us to come forward with boldness to the throne of grace. We can also say that the throne of grace is also Christ Himself. How can we say this? Rom. 5:21, speaks about grace reigning in us. Grace is enthroned in us. Grace is a throne in us. He's the preeminent One in us, as grace, as the enjoyment of the Triune God. What determines what we do and say? Grace in us. Rom. 5:17 says those who receive the abundance of grace will reign in life. When you are filled with grace you reign in life. Not only does grace reign in you, you also reign in the divine life. John says of His fullness we have all received and grace upon grace. We are receiving the abundance of grace so that grace reigns in us. He is a Person and He is a throne in our being.

Exo 25:17 refers to the expiation cover of the ark. The ark has a lid on it. In the NT that expiation cover equals the propitiation place in Rom. Paul saw that the lid on the ark was Christ. That's astounding to me. He had to be reading Exo. 25. He saw that the lid on the ark was Christ Himself. God set forth Christ as the propitiation place for us. If you look at Exodus 25. That expiation cover was the place where God meets and speaks to His redeemed people. The very place where God meets with us, where God speaks to us. Christ is our meeting place. Where God speaks to us. The expiation cover is the throne of grace. That throne of grace is the very place, the very Christ who dwells in our spirit. That place is the meeting place. If we meet upon Him, He speaks to us from that place. That lid of the ark, it covers the law, and it's also sprinkled with the blood. By Christ being our place of propitiation, by Him appeasing God, meeting all God's demands, He can speak Himself into us, just by that fact He becomes our meeting place. The lid of the ark covers the law. The cherubim were on both ends, signifying the glory of God. You have God's righteousness, holiness and glory are met by Christ as that expiation cover. When the glory who's God Himself as glory, when He looks at us, He sees Christ, He sees the blood of Christ, and the law which is filled with God's righteous requirements is covered by Christ as our propitiation place.

To give Him the position to reign in us we have to have a clear sky. That's why we need to confess our sins. Light shines, light has a killing effect. The shining of the light in us kills all the negative things. The light that shone on Saul killed so many negative things in Saul of Tarsus. Saul in the old testament was very tall, his appearance was striving. Saul in the NT, his name was changed to Paul, which means little. Eph. 3:8, to me less than the least of all saints. He really meant that. That's how he felt. Light has a killing effect, a supplying effect, also a convicting effect. When we get into the light of the Lord's presence. When we're fellowshipping with the Lord, the Lord will shine within us. We see more of who He is and more of who we are. Isaiah said, In the year King Josiah died. In the second lifestudy brother Lee said this was a vision Isaiah saw in his depression. If you're in a state of depression there's a chance to see a vision. He was depressed because Josiah died. He saw the Lord, sitting on the throne, a high and lofty throne . v5, woe is me, for I am finished. By seeing the Lord on that high and lofty throne, His exclamation was woe I am finished. I am a man of unclean lips yet my eye has seen the king. When your eyes see the king, your first response is you're a man of unclean lips. One of the seraphim flew to the altar, took and ember with a pair of tongs and touched Isaiah's mouth and said now that this has touched your lips your iniquity is taken away , your sin is purged. That ember is the application of Christ's redemptive work. Then the voice of the Lord said, Whom will I send and who will go for Us. (He is the I-Us). Isaiah said, here am I, send me. When you see Him to such an extent and you realise you're unclean and the Lord applies the effectiveness of His redemption, and then you become sendable.

Dan. 5, the king was having a party, full of debauchery.  He brought out the vessels of the temple, instructed them to put wine in those vessels and drink out of those vessels. All of a sudden the king looks at the wall and there's a hand there writing on the wall. The Bible says this, when he saw that, his knees were knocking together. These words were written on the wall. His mother told him about Daniel. They summoned Daniel. Daniel told Belshazzar about his father Nebuchadnezzar. When your forefather's heart was lifted up his spirit became so arrogant and conducted himself in pride, he was removed from his throne and his glory taken away from him. Daniel interpreted Nebuchadnezzar's dream. Daniel was telling him you need to repent. You need to realise that the heavens rule. God sets men on the throne under his rule. God is letting you have this. The Lord gave him twelve months to repent. He was on the roof of the palace, he said, look at Babylon the Great which I have built up by the might of my power and the majesty of my ??. As soon as he said that he was driven from the sons of men and his heart became like a beast. Daniel said you're going to be like this until seven periods of time pass over you. Seven weeks, or 49 days. Until you come to know that he most high is the ruler over the kingdom of men and he gives it to whomever he wills. Daniel told his descendant this. Then he turns to Belshazzar. And you have not hardened your heart though you knew all this. But the God in who's hand is your breath and who all your ways belong you have not honoured. That part of the hand was sent before God and this writing was inscribed. So he tells him what the writing was. Three words. Mene, upharso and tekel. Daniel interprets. Mene means God has numbered your kingdom and brought it to an end. I'm so thankful for Daniel. He didn't play politics. Upharsome. Tekel means you have been weighted in the scales and found to be lacking. When we read that we have to say, Lord Jesus. **The weight of a person before God is the degree of that person's subjection to God's authority.** How much do we subject to God's authority determines our spiritual weight before God. The other word, your kingdom has been divided and given to the Medes and Persians. That great image with Babylon. Then Medo-Persian. Then the Grecian Empire, then the Roman Empire. In that very night Belshazzar was slain and the Darius the Mede received the kingdom. That very night a momentous thing took place. The kingdom of Babylon was over.

Lord, I like to give you the highest and prominent position in my Christian life. In the past I always wondered how can we obey God? I always put it as an Old Testament thing. Then I realised we have a person in us, and He is our life, and that life is a life of submission and obedience. When we touch Him and experience Him we touch Him as our submissive life to the Father.

### C. blue- God's ruling presence

When we are filled with God's ruling presence, we bring the atmosphere and condition of God's ruling presence with us wherever we go. Many times it has nothing to do with what a person says. When brother Nee went to visit sister Barbara, just when he entered her house he would have the sense of God's presence. Many times when I was in brother Lee's presence I was convicted of my sins. He had the Lord's presence. He was the most absolute believer I have ever seen in my whole life. Christ was His absoluteness. Lord forgive me for not being absolute for you. The inner reaction I had was because I was with a person filled with God's ruling presence.

From LS Ezekiel, brother Lee points out to have a clear sky with a throne is to have God's ruling presence. You have to have a clear sky.

> I can testify that I'm afraid only of one thing, that I would lose the presence of the Lord. Many time alone in my room I declared in my room that the only thing I fear is losing the Lord's presence. As long as I have the presence of the lord I am afraid of nothing. I care only for his present, not for anything else. I care only for the clear sky with the throne above it. I have the full assurance as I am speaking these word that the throne is with me. in your local church you should not care for anything but having the clear sky with the throne above it. opposition and criticism mean nothing. The only thing we need to care for is the clear sky with the throne above it.

### D. 

## II. We must take, experience and enjoy Christ as our Lord

1 Cor. 5:9, we are determined to gain the honour of being well pleasing to Him. v14, the love of Christ constrains us that those who live may no longer live to themselves but to Him who died for them and has been raised.

To live is to live to the Lord. Rom. 14, whether we live we live to the Lord. The love of Christ saved you that you wouldn't live to yourself but to live to Him. To live *to Him* is the highest.

### A. We must live **to** the Lord

The love of Christ constrains us like a narrow walled road. I remember coming home from work one time, I wasn't having such a good day. I hadn't been enjoying the Lord enough. I saw a brother sitting on my doorstep looking downcast. I knew he wanted fellowship. Inwardly I cried to the Lord, lend me three loaves. I went to the brother and said, brother what's wrong. He said, you know I'm thinking of leaving the recovery. So we fellowshipped. Of course I got shepherded too. What happened was, I felt the constraining love of Christ came in. It forcibly limits you. It's in your spirit and poured out in your heart. That love constrains us so that we can live to Him.

You can be for the Lord but still be under your own direction, control. care for your own aims and goals. We have to be those who live *to* the Lord. We want *His* preferences. We want what *He* likes, what *He* prefers. Brother Lee visited one place where they served him dumplings. To brother Lee they weren't thoroughly cooked. But when they did that they weren't living to him, they were considering what they preferred and they liked. But it caused him to have stomach problems. If we're living to someone we want to take care of their likes and preferences.

### B. Rom. 14:8-9, whether we live we live to the Lord and whether we die we die to the Lord

Why did Christ die and why did He resurrect? That He might be Lord. That He might be Lord in *you*. That He might be *your* Lord.

He might be our indwelling Lord - the Lord Spirit.

We labour in the Lord and do the work of the Lord.

1 Cor. 15:58, therefore my beloved brothers be steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord

A labour in resurrection. Resurrection is the realm of impossibility. In the human realm it's impossible with man. When you're in the realm of resurrection it's possible with God. What is the work of the Lord? To work Himself into us. Whenever we care for people we want Christ to flow out of us.

1 Cor. 16:10, [Timothy] is working the work of the Lord, even as I am.

The work of the Lord is to let the Triune God work Himself into our entire being.

### C. We do not preach ourselves but Christ Jesus as Lord.

In these big evangelistic rallies, you have these big "spiritual giants" (that age is over, this is the age of raising up the one talented members). She said, they will get someone to give their testimony. It might be an athlete or a great person in the world. A lot of times they're athletes. When this person, who was a brother, when he was done testifying, what I was impressed with was him. He was preaching was himself. He was what he was testifying. We need to give our testimony, but in the giving of our testimony, what should be realised in people is that Christ Jesus is Lord. It if wasn't for Him I wouldn't be here.

1 Pet. 5:3, talks about the elders and he tells the elders, don't Lord it over your allotment. Over the saints. Instead be their pattern. That's how you take the lead. Now saints, this is a terrible situation when you lord if over the brothers and sisters. You become their lord. The Lord isn't their lord. They come to you and they want you to tell them what to do. The Lord is the one who tells us what to do. If you read ch 1 of "the spirit and the body", messages given at 1978 when there was a brother among us who called himself the universal coordinator of the one new man. That should be Christ as the Lord and the Head. He would tell people move here, move there. Brother Lee said, who are you to tell anyone where to move? Who do you think you are? He said when you tell someone where to move that's an insult to Christ's headship. We need to exhort all the brothers and sisters to pray and go to their head and pray, Lord what shall I do? Pauls' first question was Who are you Lord? His second, What shall I do, Lord? I will quote brother. Brother Lee said blessed are those who ask this questions. What shall I do Lord? Many times we are on automatic pilot. We never check with the Lord. Is this what you want me to do? Don't tell anybody where to move. Don't move anywhere just because a brother told you to move there. If you do either one you are insulting the Lord's headship. Did you pray? That doesn't mean you shouldn't have fellowship. We should honour the Lord as the Head and have fellowship to honour the Body. But the people who come to us for fellowship, we need to be careful. Did you pray? Did you have any feeling from the Lord? What impression did you get from the Lord? You might share, we had some feeling, but we want you to pray about it. That's the proper way to do things. There's only one exception. IN the collected works is a message, "who are our co-workers." Paul had less then ten people that he could tell, go there, come here, come to me. He said Timothy go there, I need you to come here. There were lots of co-workers. Paul wouldn't talk to them like that. Brother Nee also had a small group of co-workers like that. Brother Lee and Peace Wang were some of those co-workers. There were a lot of co-workers in China. Most of them brother Nee would tell them to pray. Even with Apollos, Paul urged Apollos much to come to you. If Paul urged Apollos much don't you think that was of the Lord? But Apollos had not desire to come. There's a picture in the work where there are some. But mostly all the saints, all the other co-workers. Don't insult the Lord's headship. We shouldn't move just because someone told us where to move. When I first moved to Irvine there wasn't anything on the lot, the ground was being prepared. We were just circling the wagons, like what do we do here? Some saints would go here or there. We chose to go to Arlington. One time I was driving to Arlington I was thinking Lord did I do the right thing coming here? So you have to have the assurance the Lord sent you here. 

## III. We must take, experience and enjoy Christ as our Head

### A. Rescued from the universal heap of collapse

Lord, make me willing to be headed up in the church life. Oh Jesus Christ, grow Thou in me. We also need to live under God's light.

### B. stay intimately connected to Him

### C. Christ is the power of God and wisdom of God

Fourfold power, resurrecting power, ascending power, subjecting power, heading up power. In a church meeting brother Ted said it's easy to remember this. RASH. Resurrecting, Ascending, Subjecting, Heading Up. We need handles to help us remember things.

### D. 'strengthen us into the inner man to make His home in our hearts though faith'

Two prayers in Ephesians. We need to build up a habit of praying those prayers until they become a daily exercise for us.

We need divine dynamite to blast us out of ourselves and into our inner man. RASH power.

### E. God is able to do superabundantly above all we ask or think according to this fourfold power

What we *think* concerning the church means something. I've known X for a long time. He was considering about coming to the training. He's a TA now. After our fellowship I was thinking about you being in the training. The Lord did superabundantly above what I thought. You're full time now. It's an absolute miracle. I'm a miracle too. 

## IV. We must take, experience, and enjoy Christ as our Husband

I could never forget when brother Lee was about to give the crystallization study of Song of Songs, he was ill and didn't think he would be able to give the study and said, let's divide these outlines among ourselves. He told me Ed you need to do this one. A few of us got together and prayed desperately that brother Lee would be able to share. Thank the Lord he was able to share. In the first message he gave, he said, the Lord gave me these two words: personal and affectionate. That's a great statement. That reminder me of John 17, Father the words you've given to me I've given to them. That's message 1 of the study. Message 2, the Lord gave me two more words. Private and spiritual. We need to pray, Lord give me a personal, affectionate, private and spiritual relationship with you. Otherwise the truth concerning deification is just doctrine to us. We might be able to say it, but that will not be something real to us and cannot come into fruition.

### A. Personal

Personal is from SS 4, draw me. Right after me you have we. Me, then we. If you say draw me, the me will turn into a we. If the Lord draws you, many others will be drawn too. But me is personal.

Abraham was the friend of God. The best prayer is praying to God as a friend.

Moses was a companion of God for the interests of God.

David and Asaph sought the shining face of God for the house of God. David said, I just want one thing, to dwell in the house of Jehovah all the days of my life.

Isaiah 60:7, I will beautify the house of my beauty. v9, I have beautified you, because you spend your days beholding the beauty of Jehovah (not only in your personal life but in the meetings). Your God, your beauty. God Himself is our beauty. Apart from God we have no beauty. v21, that I may be beautified. On the one hand he beautifies us that He might be beautified. It takes place by the divine dispensing of the Triune God.

The Lord Jesus lived in the presence of God without ceasing. "He has not left me alone." Many years ago a conference was going to be given when I was younger. Benson said maybe you can come. I prayed and realised this has to be the Lord's will. But I was so filled with fear. The Lord gave me this verse. He who sent me is with me, he has not left me alone. 

John 16:32, an hour is coming when all of your will be scattered. You will leave me alone but I am not alone because the Father is with Me. - maybe it was brother Nee and he felt lonely and asked the Lord to forgive him for feeling lonely because he had the Lord with him. Andrew Yu arranged me to go to a medical facility once. I felt like I was alone. Then the Lord reminded me of this. Ed, you're not alone. I'm with you. So I repented and enjoyed that very much.

Peter's love for the Lord was restored.

Paul was constrained by the Love of Christ to live in the person of Christ.

2 Cor 2:10, Paul forgave a brother in the person of Christ, the face of Christ. Paul lived in the person, the face of Christ, in all that he did. 

Paul was an ambassador of Christ. I was with Benjamin Chen to the Dom Republic. I esteemed him so highly. I accompanied him. On the way back I passed through Miami through the security. A man said, sir, are you a senator? I said no, I'm not a senator, I'm an ambassador of Christ. He said, that's much better.

### B. Affectionate

Verse 2, let Him kiss me with the kisses of His mouth. A kiss is the most affectionate contact you have with a person. You can only kiss one person at a time. So it's also personal. But it's affectionate. We brothers are part of the wife of Christ. We brothers also need to participate in the female aspect.

The Lord who indwells us is our Father and grace is our mother. Isa 66. He has a relationship with us as a mother. How could Paul say I was like a nursing mother to you. Is 66, you will be carried on the hip, bounced on the knees, as one whose mother comforts, so I will comfort you.

The Lord is our Husband

The Lord is our friend and councillor

The Lord is our advocate, comforter and shepherd.

Advocate can be like a patron, a lawyer. If the devil bothers us, tell him, talk to my lawyer.

### C. Private

Matt 6:6, enter into your private room and pray to your Father who is in secret.

??, Arise, shine, for your light has come... then you will see and you will beam (to beam Christ into people)

Bring every matter before the Lord and consider, examine things before the Lord. The children of Israel made a big mistake because they did not ask the council of Jehovah.

**Every believer needs to be weak to the extent he does not have his own ideas, make his own decisions, or take any action related to what he encounters without contacting the Lord and consulting with Him, allowing Him to make the decisions; this the sweetest living of a Christian.**

**It is glorious for a Christian to be dependant on another One - God - at every moment and in every matter.**

### D. Spiritual

Verse 4, His chambers, indicates our spirit

## V Taking, experiencing and enjoying Christ as our King, our Lord, Our Head, and our Husband is for the building up of the church as the Body of Christ to consummate the New Jerusalem
