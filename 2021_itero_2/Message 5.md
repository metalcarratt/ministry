# Our need to walk in newness of life, to serve in newness of Spirit, and to be renewed in our inner man day by day



This is not only our need but God's need. The whole world is heading to corruption and oldness. The Lord is heading to newness, to the New Jerusalem. Everything else is tending toward decay and oldness an corruption. God is heading toward newness, this new creation. We have this need to walk in newness of life, to serve in newness of Spirit, because our God is a God of newness. He does not want anything of oldness. As we go on in our Christian life we become older and older but that is contrary to God, who is newness.

## I. He who sits on the throne said, Behold I make all things new

We know that when the Lord Jesus was on the cross He said, It is finished. His redemptive work was finished. In Rev. 16 at the pouring out of the seventh bowl as the final act of God's judgement the angel says aloud, It is done. God's economy, God's judgement upon this earth is finally completed. But in 21 He who sits on the throne says, Behold I make all things new. God's work need to be done. We may be happy with that. He is not happy merely to see His work done. At the end of the Bible we are told He makes all things new. At the end of the Bible we see not only the completion of all the works, we see the coming forth of a new creation. This is God's heart's desire. God does not merely desire to see His work completed, He wants to see something new brought forth. Unless a new creation, a New Jerusalem comes forth, He will not be satisfied.

## II. As believers in Christ we have been made a new creation - a person regenerated with the life of God and living in the inner man, not in the outer man

Something happened to our being when we were regenerated. Not just something outwardly, upon us. John 3, we have been born anew. A birth took place. When a person believes in the Lord he does not merely adopt to a new idea. Something happens intrinsically. He was born anew. He becomes a new creation. We are not converts. We are not converted. We have been born anew. A new nature, a new essence has been imparted into us to make us a new creation.

Gal. 6, neither circumcision not uncircumcision matters. What matters is a new creation. Just to be a good Christian, behaving, a good person doesn't matter. What matters is a new creation.

## III. As a new creation in Christ Jesus we need to walk in newness of life

How we live must reflect what we are. We are not merely sinners saved by grace. We are a new creation. Our walk must reflect this change that has happened in our being. When we baptise a new one, we encourage him to live a new life. It's true. In that sense we admonish him you should walk like a new person. But the matter goes deeply. It's not just now he's going to start a new life again. It's not that now you've believed you'd better turn over a new leaf, have a new start. As a new creation, we need to walk in newness of life. Don't just put on new clothing, adjust your outward habit or manner. Instead of going to the casino you go to church. That's what's on the outside. We have to walk in newness of life. It's not just a newness of behaviour or habit, it's a newness of life.

A. to live in the realm of resurrection

Related to Christ's rising from the dead. Not to start with a new habit or behaviour. The newness of life is a life in resurrection. Resurrection implies it is a life that emerges out of death. Through baptism we died with Christ. Through death we were raised together with Him in resurrection. *So also*, we might walk in newness of life. We  reign in life. The newness of life we walk in is a resurrection life and a reigning life.

B. 

Rom. 6:4 is a continuation of the thought in 5. In 5 we were reconciled through the death of His Son. Now much more we will be saved in His life. We are not just redeemed people. We have been redeemed from God's judgement, sin, death, yet there are still hundreds of things we need to be saved from day by day. We still need to be saved, even much more, from a host of things. From our temper, our lust, our self. You may have been regenerated, saved from God's judgment. You need to be saved much more from all the things not compatible with God's life. We are being saved in this life moment by moment.

5:17 the reigning in life. This life enthrones us to a position to rule over all things. Not over others. To be kings, to reign with Christ over all negative things, including our temper, our self and all negative things. To reign over all the things that are not incompatible with God's life.

We need to walk in the newness of this life, this saving life, this reigning life, this resurrection life.

C.

The death and resurrection of Christ are closely related to each other. It's hard to separate these two processes. Death is typified by baptism. We should never belittle that step of baptising someone. It's never just a procedure or formality. Baptism is a reality. In baptism a person is being put into another person. He was in the old Adam. Now he is being transferred into Christ. As he is raised from that water, that typifies resurrection. Everyone we baptise someone there should be that kind of realisation in the baptiser. We are not just carrying out some kind of religious procedure. The death and resurrection of Christ go together. Baptism is something living. Rom 6:5, for if we have grown together with him in the likeness of His death we will also be with Him in the likeness of His resurrection.

Baptism is a growing process. It is something living. Indeed we will also be in the likeness of His resurrection. It is like a person planting a seed into the soil. You may say I'm burying that seed The soil breaks down the shell. The inner germ begins to break forth, that's resurrection When you put the seed into the soil is it dying or living? Both. When Christ was hanging on the cross, was He dying there? Yes, but at the same time He was being made alive.

To fully understand this concept you need to understand the concept of grafting. The two pieces of wood have to be cut and then joined. We are experiencing death and resurrection at the same time.

E.

Whenever we turn to this Spirit, we call Lord Jesus, you are spontaneously ushered into the realm of resurrection.

F.

A living that deals with all of Adam in us until we are fully transformed and conformed and transfigured.

## IV. As a new creation in Christ Jesus, we need to serve in newness of spirit

Two husbands. Married to our old man, bound by the law, made subject by the law. Through the death of Christ the former husband died. Now the law cannot impose upon us that regulation. We are free to marry another, a new husband, Christ. We enter into a new marriage. A funeral and wedding took place on the same day. We have funeral for our old man, our old husband and we are married to our new husband, Christ.

As the recovery is marching forward, by next year 100 years. Many of us having been serving here for many years. There is a danger our service becomes formal, stale, lifeless, old. In this training we are touching this matter of God's need. God won't be happy to come back to old priests faithfully taking care of matters. He is looking for a new fresh bride. Not only our living should be in newness of life, even our service should be living. The law has been holding us back, keeping us in bondage.

After serving for some years we "know all the ropes". We can do things with our eyes closed. Without much freshness of the spirit. It refers to our spirit. Whatever we do in our service must bear the testimony of the freshness of the spirit. You can prophecy, give opening Word, closing Word, but how much freshness of the spirit is there? It's easy to pick up methods and ways. As much as we are burdened for the God ordained way, got BNPB, we should serve in newness of spirit, not allow that to become a formality of any sort. We are not just a disciple of Christ, we are a new creation.

A. 

Even our prophecy can be composed nicely. It's good to have something prepared beforehand, but if you just rely on that and read that, that's lifeless. You need to speak that in the spirit. When you come to speak something before the Lord, the best thing is throw your notes away. Exercise your spirit and flow out the Lord. That would be the newness of the spirit. Not to serve by the oldness of the letter.

B, C, D.

Enter into that organic union with Him. We have grown with Him in the likeness of His death. Along with that is the resurrection of Christ. To have the newness of spirit, we need the terminating of the old husband. Now we have been discharged. Now we can marry to another, our new husband, Christ.

E.

Newness is not a new style, new tricks, new way of doing things. Newness is God Himself. He is in our mingled regenerated spirit. There is a source of newness there because God is there. The soul is full of oldness. Whenever you fall into your soul, you may have a smart mind but there is not life there. It is just a lot of logic, a lot of reasoning. It is only when you touch the spirit that you touch life.

## V. The Christian life is a life of being renewed; we need to be renewed in our inner man day by day

We saw that at the time of our believing in Christ we became a new creation, and that is true, as far as the fact is concerned. 2 Cor. 4:16, our inner man is being renewed day by day. We are already new. Why do we need to be renewed. Put on the new man, which is being renewed. Here he pointed out we are the new man. Christ created the new man on the cross. We have to put on that new man. Then he says " which is being renewed" The renewing process is not completed yet. We are already a new creation, but in our experience day by day we are still in the process of being renewed.

A.

The outer man is not just the body. The body is the organ. But something drives and activates that organ, which is the soul. Our current present soul is the person of that outer man. After our regenerated, now there is an inner man in us. Not merely our spirit. The spirit is the person and life, the soul is the organ. Our spirit becomes an inner man. There is a person within us. Our renewed soul becomes just an organ or the spirit.s

B.

We see the need of renewing in 2 Cor. 4:16. In order for that renewing to take place we have to refer back to the earlier verses, 10-12, always bearing about in the body the putting to death of Jesus. Paul talks about his own experience. He was always bearing about the putting to death of Jesus. It is something continuous. He is constantly being put to death. What does it mean for the outer man to be consumed? Our soul with our body to be worn away. God uses a lot of our environment to wear out our natural life, our old man. Through the work of the cross, much of the time we experience the breaking. In this time of pandemic we feel the limitation. We cannot go the places we'd like to go, do the things we'd like to do. God even uses all these restrictions to wear away our outer man. As our outer man is being consumed, the inner man is being renewed day by day. We are so strong, so determined. Nothing can deter us. God has to use all these situations to defeat us. Just like Jacob in the OT. God used all his environment to consume him. His smartness, his cleverness, his supplanting skill. He was like an iron wall, nothing could penetrate. If you don't allow yourself to be consumed no renewing will take place.

We cannot deny in our daily live we are not that new. Old inclinations, old thoughts, old habits. We still live by right and wrong, good and evil. Not much conscious of how much God has a place in me. God has to use the consuming environment to open a crack so that the life can seep in.

Paul said he longs for transfiguration. Not to be naked, but to be clothed upon. He was ambitious to please the Lord and so would live to Him. He aspired to not live by himself but to live unto the Lord.

It's one thing to say I'm justified. It's another thing to say you are God's righteousness. The need of reconciliation to the uttermost to arrive at righteousness. In the new heaven and new earth where righteousness dwells.

The cross is the greatest help to accomplish the renewing for us. Along with the cross we need the Holy Spirit. Whenever we touch the Holy Spirit we are being renewed.

God' ever new essence dispensed into us. Our old natural elements are being discharged.

We are not going to the NJ, we are becoming the NJ.

C.

Not all sufferings will bring us into glory. Common suffering. Everyone suffers in the pandemic, for example. It is a general kind of suffering God measured to mankind. Suffering due to sin and our mistakes and failures. If you keep showing up at your job late and get fired. You don't come to the meeting and tell the saints I suffered this loss of a job. That suffering will not bring you more glory. There is a suffering related to Christ. Not all sufferings are beneficial. Only the suffering that is genuinely for the name of Christ and for the church.

Don't think just because you passed through a big blow of suffering you will get a lot of renewing. The renewal is a gradual process. Some saints can bear big sufferings, big persecutions. They will stand firm. But they are not able to bear little sufferings like a scolding by a friend or a criticism by a saint or a long face from a spouse. They can take the imprisonment but you can't take a little word from people.

D.

Renewing takes place by a law of life.

The leading part of our soul is our mind. Allow the spirit to penetrate into our thinking, our logic will affect a metabolic change in our being.

E.

The divine life has the capacity to energize this renewing process in us.

If God is going to have the NJ he needs to have the new creation with us today. We need to be continually renewed little by little, day by day.
