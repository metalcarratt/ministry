# Message 4 - Prayer to absorb God and to express God by praying to God as a friend so that we can co-work with God

What can more more closely related to our meeting God's need that our prayer? Nothing could be more direct. We know that in God's economy He has established principles that He Himself is governed by. One of those is that He does not and will not act or move unless somebody prays. So think about it. All of the needs. God's needs. What does He need? He needs a lot of things. In His heart are so many things concerned man. Let's take an elementary one. He would like to save someone, would like to regenerate someone. He can only do it if someone prays. I read in history regarding the Welsh revival. Something like 70,000 people were saved during the Welsh revival. Evan Roberts was no doubt a very gifted evangelist. I always though that's what powered the revival. But Jesse Pen Lewis said every single one of those people who were gained were prayed for by name. How about that? We have to believe that is true. He has limited Himself to man's cooperation. Can you imagine what a responsibility we have? We are at the end of human history, church history. The kind of need God has now is very particular and will need a very particular kind of cooperation with a very particular kind of prayer.

Four points in the title. The sequence is important:

1. The meaning of prayer is to absorb God. One thing that has to happen is that God must be mingled with man. If that doesn't happen, nothing else will happen.
2. The expression of God comes out of the absorbing of God. Not a natural prayer that originates with man or man's need or man's concept of God's need.
3. Not a formal prayer. It's praying to God as a friend. Not a religious prayer. It's a special kind of prayer. In our human conversation, if I've never met you and we're meeting for the first time, we might speak rather formally. But if we're friends, I speak differently to my friend. There's nothing formal or planned. It's very spontaneous.
4. If we are able to pray to God as a friend we are able to truly co-work with God.

We all have a natural concept when it comes to the matter of prayer. We hear the word prayer and think, "I know what prayer is." Yes, we do something every day that we call pray. But whether it's really prayer or not is for God to decide. We have our own thought about prayer. I know there's more than one kind of prayer. There is a prayer that's for man's need. But in the pattern of prayer in Matt. 6 when the Lord told the disciples how to pray, He put God's need at the beginning and man's need at the end. Man's need is trivial. Man's need is something God adds automatically when we take care of God's need. How many people on this earth today will offer to you what they call a prayer. Maybe millions or hundreds of millions. I can imagine God listening to these prayers and say, "Does anybody know what I need? I'm hearing requests, but none of them have anything to do with what I need?" To pray what God needs requires us to know God's need, and that requires an intimate relationship with Him as a friend.

Hosea. Take with you words and turn to Jehovah. That's one kind of prayer. The kind of prayer we're going to talk about today is, don't bring any word. Whatever we bring to this kind of prayer will be a hinderance to our prayer.

## I. The meaning of prayer is to absorb God, the more we contact God the more we will absorb Him and the more we absorb Him the more we will enjoy Him as light and salvation.

The meaning of prayer is to absorb God. People think the meaning of prayer is to let your requests be made known to God. It's not wrong, but it's not the intrinsic meaning of prayer. He gave us a human spirit designed specifically by Him to have this ability to absorb God. No other creature has that. That's what He wants us to do every time we pray, no matter what we pray for. Every time we come to pray we should absorb something of God Himself. 

A.

Psa. 27:4,  David says one thing I have asked from Jehovah (reminds me of Paul's word in Phil. 3), to dwell in the House of Jehovah all the days of my life, to behold the beauty of the Lord and inquire in His temple. In verse 1 he says Jehovah is my light and my salvation. He doesn't say Jehovah gives me light and brings me salvation. He is those things and becomes those things to us, when we absorb Him. He doesn't give us strength apart from Himself. God Himself is what we need. Sometimes we make our Christian life very complicated.

B. Beholding

David contacted and absorbed God by beholding God as beauty. This seeker of God said I want to be in His temple, I want to behold the beauty of the Lord, and to inquire. The NT reality is even greater. Beholding God as our beauty is a great secret to experiencing God for His desire.

2 Cor. 3 - beholding. We all with unveiled face beholding and reflecting like a mirror the glory of the Lord are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit. According to this verse, beholding the Lord transforms you. How about that? Just by seeing Him you are transformed. All of us realise our great need of transformation. The secret to transformation is beholding. Although we quote this verse quite often sometimes we neglect the context. We have to have a way to behold him. To behold you is easy, you're visible. He's invisible. Should I look up? Is he there? The context of 2 Cor. 3 is the reading of the scriptures. Whenever Moses is read a veil lies on their heart, but whenever the heart turns the veil is taken away. The way, in Paul's thought, that you behold the Lord is through His Word. Isn't that your experience? It's very vague, abstract, if I say I want to behold the Lord. But when I have the Word of God I feel I'm looking at His face. In the very next chapter Paul talks about the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ. Where can we get it? How can we get it? How we learned how to do it? It's very possible that we pray, read the Holy Word for morning revival, we read the ministry excerpts. But after you have done that can you testify that you absorbed Him and beheld Him. If not, we're not doing it properly. I'm afraid many saints among us don't know how to absorb the Lord, how to behold Him, and how to inquire of Him.

Eph. 5. On the one hand our beholding transforms us. On the other hand this involves the removal of negative things (spots and wrinkles). These are subjective parts of our being, not behavioural things. They can only removed by the washing of the water in the Word. This transformation is twofold - the removal of the negative things and the addition of God Himself. Human metabolism is perhaps the best illustration of transformation. "Cadabolism" involves the removal of negative things from your body. "Anabolism" involves the addition of the nutrients that you need to build up your physical body. I hope we can get this basic thought. When we talk about prayer, don't think prayer is one thing, reading the scripture is another. They should go together, the more the better.

C. Just as I am

Just as I am means we should come to God just as we are without trying to improve our change our condition. We received Christ in this way, we should walk in Christ in this way. We came in a very pitiful condition. I have no way to change it. But he received me, just as I was. In our Christian life we will have failures, shortcoming, defects. All manner of things that discourage us. Walk in the same way that we received Him initially. He already knows. Much better than you. Lord, only you and I know. It's our secret. Just how bad I really am. But thank You, You still received me. There's no pretence when we come to Him. Why be formal, why compose a prayer? Just speak to Him in a genuine way. In John 4 an exceedingly sinful woman composes something religious. The Lord said, cut it out. Just be truthful. Don't talk to me about the worship of God. Talk to me about the five men who were your husbands. She got the point. She also got the living water. She got God Himself. What does God hear when He hears my prayer? Does He hear the prayer of a friend? Genuine prayer? Or does He hear what I think He wants to hear. Hallelujah! We can come to Him just as we are. Every day. We can come to Him when we are weak and when we are in failure.

D.

No matter what our inner condition is, we should bring it to God.

E.

Looking to Him, beholding Him, praising Him, worshipping Him, absorbing Him. Then we will enjoy God's riches, taste His sweetness. We will learn the lesson of staying connected when we are ministering to the saints. You might say I'm not on the podium. Yes you are. When you speak to the saints, in the prophesying meetings and when we meet the saints. "How to enjoy God and how to practice the enjoyment of God", chapter 5. How to enjoy God in prayer. There are ten points. The first nine points are all on this kind of absorbing prayer. The tenth point is on inquiring prayer or interceding prayer. It shows you how little we really know about this kind of prayer.

## II. Christ as the good land is the rich soil in which we have been rooted so that we may grow with the elements absorbed from the soil

Everybody received an allotment that they were required to work on, to labour on. Col. 1 talks about the allotted portion Col 2 says you got planted in your allotted portion. You got organically joined to that land. You have rooted into that land. How about this? This is Col. 2:6-7. The NT reality is, we are planted into Christ as the land. We absorb the nutrients from Christ. And we grow into His building, His dwelling place. Much more subjective that the type.

A, B.

Transplanted by the water. A tree beside the water grows by absorbing the riches of the water. It's all invisible. The roots your see above ground are big, but the roots that actually absorb the nutrients are small. Constantly underground. Constantly receiving. They can't receive a lot at one time. Your body can only use so much water in a certain period of time. When I was young, I was very active. Sometimes we'd just drink a gallon of water. Actually you can't use that much. It'll quench your thirst but it'll just go through you. Sometimes we're like this with the Word of the ministry. You can only take in a little at a time. That's the only way we can do it.

Isa. the evil condition of the wicked is that they do not come to the Lord to eat and enjoy the Lord. They do many things, but they do not come to contact the Lord, to receive Him, to taste Him and enjoy Him. In the sight of God nothing is more evil than this. God's dictionary is very different from ours. Webster can't help you to understand wickedness. God has a definition of wickedness and evil. Jer. my people have committed two evil, they have forsaken me the fountain of living waters, and have hewn out for themselves cisterns, broken cisterns which hold no water. God's definition of wickedness is to not absorb Him, not drink Him, not receive Him. That's what meets God's need. So the opposite of what meets God's need is wicked. You say sin is wicked. Of course it is. But sin is so easily identified. It's a wicked thing if we go through our day without absorbing God. It's evil in the sight of God. I hope this would impress us.

C, D.

Holding the head is equal to being rooted in the soil - remaining connected without any insulation between we and Him.

Paul describes the soil we are rooted in. Eight items. This is what we're absorbing, the kind of soil we've been planted into:

- v9 "in Him dwells all the fulness of the Godhead bodily" Do we need anything else?
- v10 "who is the Head of all rule and authority." His headship, Lordship, rulership.
- v11 "in whom we were circumcised." the dealing with the flesh. We can't cut off our flesh. But absorb the soil.
- v12 "buried together with Him" he buried our old man.
- v13 "He made us alive." Resurrection.
- v14 "He wiped out the hand-writing in ordinances" Those ordinances were against us.
- v15 "Stripped off the rulers and authorities." Defeated Satan, the evil spirits and angels.
- v10, "We are made full in Him."

G.

Growth is building.

H.

In some ways the most important point on this outline.

Daily allow adequate time for prayer. Musing, is not something you do quickly. It takes time.



## III. The meaning of prayer is also for us to express God

It is possible our prayer actually expresses ourself. The is why we need the Lord it train us.

To inquire is to let God speak. Ohh. Not so easy. It requires a strong exercise of our spirit. Why? Because He is invisible and His speaking is inaudible. I'm learning. Just inquire. Lord, what's in Your heart concerning this matter? What would you like to do about this situation? You say I'm just speaking to the air, how's He going to answer me? He's going to answer you by the anointing in our spirit. We need to learn this. It helps to have the Word of God. Many times that's how He will speak. 

A.

Real prayer. Oh, saints. We want real prayer. Coming to God. Letting God speak within us. Expressing to God what He has spoken back to Him. I love this. When you say, "seek my face," to you my heart says, "your face of Jehovah will I seek."

B.

Abide in me.

We must abide in the Lord - to remain in fellowship with the Lord. The Lord's words must abide in us. When we abide in the Lord and are in constant fellowship He speak within us. Our asking the Lord comes from the Lord's speaking within us. Prayer is not our composition, it's His words repeated back to Him.

C.

I feel I have a lot to learn about this kind of prayer.

D.

Principles or secrets to contacting the Lord. Six of them.

1. We should not direct the Lord in our prayer. Ask. What shall I do Lord?
2. He causes us to see our needs and points out our problems. The way to take the living water is to confess these sins to the Lord.
3. We should seek the Lord Himself as the unseen spiritual matters.
4. Human opinions frustrate the Lord's power. Lazarus had no opinions for the Lord, he just received the resurrection power.
5. Let Him do what He wills.
6. Even when we fail the Lord will manifest Himself to us.

E. Inquiring

David asks over and over, should I go and fight this battle?

## IV. The best prayer is to pray to God as a friend. Abraham was a the friend of God; in Genesis 8 the God of heaven humbled Himself in order to befriend Abraham.

Just read Genesis 8 again. Jehovah stayed there after the angels left. He said how can I hide in my heart from my friend Abraham. So he tells him. Abraham's speaking is so interesting. What if there's 50 righteous people there. The Lord said, no I won't destroy it. What if there's 40. Far be it from you to destroy the good from the wicked. Shall not the judge of the whole earth do right? Can you speak that way to God? He got it down to five. It doesn't sound like prayer, does it. It doesn't sound like any kind of prayer we've ever prayed in our whole life. Read it again and said, 'this is prayer'.  I began to converse with the Lord in a very human way. When you pray formal prayers you can't pray very long. But if you pray to God in a conversational way you can pray for hours. You're just speaking. I started to do that and it revolutionised my prayer.

C, D.

As he was fellowshipping with God he received revelation from God - regarding the birth of Isaac on the positive side and the destruction of Sodom on the negative side. 

E.

God wanted to preserve Lot's family so He presented it in a vague way. But Abraham picked it up.

Ezek. 23:30, I was looking for a man to stand in the breach but I found no-one (looking for an intercessor)

Isa. I was appalled that there was no intercessor. This distresses God. He's unable to fulfil His intention unless there's an intercessor.

You're not going to look up in the sky and see writing in the sky. You will have a sense in your spirit.



## V. Two aspects of prayer - fellowship with God, anointed for the work; intercession, inquiry, co-working.

Correspond to the two altars in the tabernacle.

May He shepherd us to pray as His friends to co-work with Him.
