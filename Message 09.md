# Message 9 - The full ministry of Christ in three stages

## I. The unique teaching of God's New Testament economy is the teaching concerning the full ministry of Christ in three stages - incarnation, inclusion and intensification

> What the Lord's recovery will be and how it will be depend upon how we handle this teaching

[A] One book called, *Incarnation, Inclusion and Intensification*. Shared with a group of co-workers. Later gave messages to elders an co-workers, *How to be a co-worker and elder and how to fulfil their obligations*. We must actually experience these things. Have I experienced it? Lord, usher me into the experience. If we pray this way we have to trust the Lord as the Spirit of reality will guide us into the reality of that thing. I'm so glad the Spirit of reality is the guide. Lord, as the Spirit of reality guide me into the reality of these truths.

> The Lord's recovery is God becoming the flesh, the flesh becoming the life-giving Spirit, and the life-giving Spirit becoming the sevenfold intensified Spirit to build up the church that becomes the Body of Christ and the consummates the New Jerusalem.

First question on test is "what does the future of the Lord's recovery depend on?" Verbatim, what is the Lord's recovery in one sentence. Oh Lord Jesus, show me what the Lord recovery is. These points need to go through our spirit into our mind. The Lord's recovery is actually the full ministry of Christ in three stages.

[B] to work together with God as co-workers we need to know Christ in His three stages.

Whenever we read these things we need to pray, Lord I want to know You in these aspects. Synonym for gaining Him. A synonym for gaining Christ is winning Christ. Christ is our prize. We want to win Christ, to gain Christ. Phil. 3:14, I pursue toward the goal for the prize. Footnote. Our goal is the fullest enjoyment of Christ, the fullest gaining of Christ. Lord bring me into the fullest enjoyment, fullest gaining of Christ. That's for the prize. 

2 Cor. 6:1, And working together with Him we also retreat you not to receive the grace of God in vain. He and God were co-workers. We are God's co-workers. We have a wonderful co-worker. He's working and we're working together with Him. Footnote 1. The life in us. We work together not by gift but by a life. An all-fitting life. It fits in any situation. Br Lee could fit in any situation because he was always exercised. I've seen him in low meetings and high meetings, but he always fit. 

In Taiwan we had a small room with eight brothers jammed into the room. We were older brothers. Some of us were tall so we had sleep in the fetal position in our beds. We were looking at the room. One brother said, brothers, how are we going to make it? I said, brother, we're going to make it together. In the Lord. In the way of blending and shepherding one another. 

Worked together by a life able to fit all situations. I love that. When I moved to Anaheim, the first meeting was a prayer meeting and it was like a bomb had gone off. I realised I have an all-fitting life. I don't have to stand up and tell everyone to turn to their spirit. I have to stay in my spirit. Brother Lee re-modelled the church in Anaheim with life. And he started with the prayer meeting. He was ill and called me on the phone. He said, this is brother Lee, I'm coming to the prayer meeting I'll see you there. He just began to build up the prayer meeting little by little. Eventually we had this prayer meeting and he said I want this prayer meeting taped and sent to all the churches. He was so touched the prayer meeting got built up to such a point he felt he wanted all the saints to hear this. How to pray short prayers. How to follow one another. If I pray a long prayer. In my prayer is three basketballs and you don't know which one to catch. O Lord revive us, then I pass to another brother. Short prayers where we can continue from one another.

One time I edited a message. I was reading it to brother Lee. He said take all of that out. It was about two pages. I said, I thought that was pretty good. He said, the audience was way down here, so I had to tell a lot of stories to bring them up here. And then I could minister the truth. So he was able to fit in that situation by telling the stories.

It's able to endure any kind of treatment. Are you able to endure any kind of treatment? Have you graduated from that? I'm still learning. Your wife gives you a look. When covid was rampant the husbands and wives get to spend a lot of time together. One time I asked Ruth asking so many question like an investigative reporter. I got her whole biography. But there were other situations, maybe your wife sees something she didn't see before. She might look at you a certain way. I said, Ruthie, why are you looking at me like that. She said I'm not looking at you any way. I was just hyper sensitive. Then I say something with a certain tone. She says why did you speak with that tone. I say, what tone? 

We can never graduate from this. Some times trainees think when they came to the training they were in a good situation and when they graduate they were worse. No, you were always that bad. You get more light and realise how apart from our spirit we are. Experiential. In my flesh is no good thing. He didn't say that doctrinally.

This life is able to accept any kind of environment. In a training you have nowhere to hide. If you're down you can't fake it. This is why we have to maintain our joy. This life accepts any kind of environment. 

This life is able to work in any kind of condition and take any opportunity for the carrying out of its ministry. This little footnote should be a beacon for us.

Phil. 3:8-14. Do I count everything as garbage apart from You? There are still things in my being that are vain appeals. In Paul's eyes everything was garbage. We need our eyes open to see the super eminence of the One who lives in us. To know Him. That I may lay hold of that. Lay hold means to seize, grasp. Christ grasped us so that we can seize Him, grasp Him. Isn't that wonderful? This always reminds me of the book of Habakkuk. "embracing, clinging to". God become a man to embrace sinners that sinners might cling to Him to become God in life and nature but not in the Godhead. 

## II. In the first stage, the stage of His incarnation, from His human birth to His death, Christ accomplished the following main things:

Illustration. Northern Chinese eat dumplings with garlic and vinegar. They kill germs and good digestion. The dumpling eaters do not become sick because they are protected by the germ killers. I cannot feed you the high peak truths without garlic (cross). I must minister garlic even though it is not sweet. 

[A] **brought infinite God into finite man**

[B] **united, mingled, incorporated God with man**

[C] **expressed bountiful God in His humanity** - in His rich attributes through aromatic virtues

Aromatic is a mystery because you can't see it. You can smell it but can't see it. The Lord displayed an aromatic power. The Lord said to Matthew, come and follow me. He just got up and left. There was some kind of power in the Lord's countenance and voice to attract and captivate people. It means if you look at the disciples like Peter, John, they were charmed, captivated. How do explain charmed? It's like love at first sight. When I was in college that was the way when I saw Ruthie. She smiled at me. I said to my roommate I said, who's that? I was charmed. Something happened. Then I hurt my knee. I was playing a sport and hurt my knee really bad and had to have surgery. She was my student nurse. I found out later she told the nurses I want to be his nurse. I didn't know she was charmed by me. Just think about Peter. Peter was rebuked so many times. If the Lord looked at you and said get behind me Satan. But Peter stuck around. 

Good Samaritan. Moved with compassion, poured oil and wine on wounds, placed on his own beast, brought to inn, whatever you spend when I return I will repay. Rom. 13:8-10, Gal. 5:14-15. The whole law is fulfilled in this, you shall love your neighbour as yourself. But if you bite and devour one another beware lest you be consumed by one another. Your neighbour is one another. I need to be one with the Neighbour to be their neighbour. He blest the church on the new one's behalf (whatever you spend). Whatever you spend in this age will be repaid at the Lord's coming back. (Luke 10:38 footnote?)

The first one saved by Christ was not a gentleman, but a criminal sentenced to death. Very meaningful.

[D] **judicial redemption**. The soul who sins, he shall die. The wages of sin is death. God is righteous. He can't break His righteous. Someone has to die. He paid those wages on the cross. He died as our substitute on the cross. He died instead of us. Not only that, we are crucified with Christ. We also died on the cross. So the penalty has been paid. Christ died for us. We died with Him. Case dismissed.

## III. In the second stage, the stage of His inclusion, from HIs resurrection to the degradation of the church, Christ accomplished the following main things:

[A] **begotten to be the firstborn Son**. The Lord was the first one to be regenerated. He was born again in His resurrection. He was born in His humanity. He was the only begotten Son. But when He entered into resurrection, You are My Son, This day I have begotten You. He was born again, a second time, on the day of resurrection. We were born with Him in resurrection.

Christ is already designated the Son of God, but we are in the process.

[B] **became a life-giving Spirit**. The all-inclusive Spirit. Our God was processed and consummated to become a law in our spirit. A spontaneous power. We just need to switch Him on. Say, Praise the Lord. Isn't that a good way to switch on?

The law of the Spirit of zoe. If Christ is in you your spirit is zoe. Regardless how you feel, your spirit is zoe. The mind set on the spirit is zoe. If we give Him the room to indwell us, He gives zoe to our mortal bodies. Have you ever come to a meeting where you felt like you could barely make it to you seat? A foretaste of our body being swallowed up with zoe. Sometimes when I speak I'm tired. 

[C] **regenerated the believers**

## IV. In the third stage the stage of His intensification, from the degradation of the church to the consummation of the New Jerusalem, Christ intensifies His organic salvation, produces the overcomers, and consummates the New Jerusalem.

[A] **intensified sevenfold**. Seven lampstands. Each lampstand has seven lamps. The seven lamps before the throne are seven Spirits. If you turn the lampstand side on it looks like one lamp. Essentially one lamp, economically seven lamps. 

Sent forth to execute God's eternal policy. Seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth to carry out His eternal administration.

[B] **intensifies His organic salvation to save His believers from**:

1. **the formal church life and loss of first love**. One time br Lee said I feel the prophecying meeting is becoming a form. He said anything without the exercise of the Spirit becomes a form. Always exercise your spirit.
2. **the defeat that leads to the taste of the second death**
3. **worliness**
4. **fornication, idolatry, demonic teachings, satanic depths**
5. ** spiritual death**
6. **losing the crown**
7. **lukewarmness and Christlessness**

[C] (1) recover our first love to the Lord. We have to love the Lord and develop our first love by giving Him the first place in all things.

[D] (2) speaking of sevenfold pneumatic Christ + (3) overcoming saints living in their Spirit. We need to pray, Lord speak to us.
