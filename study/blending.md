## The Experience of God's Organic Salvation Equaling Reigning in Christ's Life CWWL, 1994â€“1997, vol. 5

> We must have the reality of the fellowship and blending of the Body of Christ. Otherwise, regardless of how much we pursue and how simple and humble we are, sooner or later there will be problems, even divisions, among us. Hence, we must be governed by the vision of the Body and follow in the footsteps of the apostle by bringing all the saints in all the churches into the blending life of the entire Body of Christ. This is to reign in life, and by such reigning, we give glory to God. This glory is the New Jerusalem, the universal [517] incorporation of the union and mingling of divinity with humanity, in which God will be completely glorified and His economy will be fully accomplished.
