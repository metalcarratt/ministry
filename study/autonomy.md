Southern California Elders' and Co-workers' Meetings
CWWL, 1993, vol. 1

> In his ministry Brother Watchman Nee emphasized the Body of Christ and stressed the matter of coordination. Upon the resumption of his ministry, Brother Nee pointed out that some make their local church a “native church” and a “small empire.” Such ones built churches in the same way that “native churches” had been built in China. A “native church” was a so-called church raised up in a village and **cut off from other influences**; in such a “church” everything was done according to the way of the village where that “church” existed. I am concerned that some dissenting ones among us are attempting to build up their own empire by **isolating the church in their locality from other churches**. Such churches are like little isolated “kingdoms.” These dissenters assert that after establishing a church and appointing elders, **the apostles should keep their hands off the church and allow it to be autonomous**. This teaching of autonomy is contrary to the teaching of the New Testament. According to the New Testament, the apostle Paul visited and wrote Epistles to the churches that he had established (Acts 18:18-21a, 23; 19:1-7; Eph. 1:1). After appointing the elders in Ephesus (Acts 20:17; cf. 14:23), Paul visited the church in Ephesus and remained with the church for three years (ch. 19; 20:31; 1 Cor. 16:8). During this time he admonished the saints in Ephesus with tears night and day and taught the saints publicly and from house to house (Acts 20:20, 31). Later, while journeying to Jerusalem, he sent some from Miletus to call for the elders of the church in Ephesus to come to him (vv. 16-17). This indicates that the church in Ephesus was not absolutely autonomous. **If the dissenting ones saw the Body of Christ, they would not dare to teach or practice absolute autonomy of local churches**.

> A certain elder may consider that every aspect of the church should be under his control. Such an elder exercises full control over the church in his locality, and no one else has any say. As a result, there is little building up of any aspect of the church life or service, including the work among the children, the preaching of the gospel, and the seeking of the growth in life. Because such ones become a frustration to the work, we have not encouraged such brothers to join others in laboring on other parts of the work. The leading ones should not be kings, having absolute authority and exercising control. Instead, they should serve as overseers, maintaining order under the headship of Christ. Those who exercise control over the churches and the saints should not be sent to carry out a work in any region, for they will become a hindrance to the work. It is better for the work to be carried out by the local saints than to be controlled by such persons.
> 
> I can testify before the Lord that I have not overstepped my measure. **It is wrong to claim that those who take the lead in the Lord’s ministry do not have spiritual authority** (cf. 2 Cor. 10:8; 13:10; 1 Thes. 2:6). In a school the teacher has authority over the students. Similarly, the authority in the Lord’s work comes from His speaking. Since the Lord has placed me in the lead in the Lord’s ministry, a certain measure of authority has been given to me.
> 
> The leadership in the New Testament does not reside with a person but with the teaching of the apostles (Acts 2:42; cf. 1 Tim. 1:3-4). Although I do not exercise control over the churches or the saints, **the Lord has entrusted me with His speaking, in which there is a measure of authority**. Even though we have passed through much opposition, the Lord’s speaking is still with me. By His grace I can testify that no one can overthrow the ministry in the Lord’s recovery, because I have ministered the word and conducted myself according to the principles that the Lord has revealed in the Bible. This does not mean that I am perfect. However, I am careful in my dealings with the ones with whom the Lord has placed me. My dealing with the saints differs depending on the ones with whom I labor. With those who are fully open to me, I can speak very freely, although I do not exercise control over them. It is easy for me to labor with those who are faithful, simple, and strict and who respect and honor this ministry, yet it is difficult for me to labor with those who are loose and unreliable.
