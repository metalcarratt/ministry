# Rehoboam
## Capable and wise
> 2Ch 11:23a And he acted wisely

## Listening to God not to fight his brothers
> 2Ch 11:4 Thus says Jehovah, You shall not go up and wage war with your brothers. Every man return to his house; for this matter is of Me. So they listened to the words of Jehovah and returned from going against Jeroboam.

## Building cities for the defence of Judah
> 2Ch 11:5 And Rehoboam dwelt in Jerusalem and built cities for defense in Judah.

## Being fundamental and not apostate
> 2Ch 11:16 And those from all the tribes of Israel who set their hearts to seek Jehovah the God of Israel came after them to Jerusalem to sacrifice to Jehovah, the God of their fathers.

## Not labouring for God's interest but transmuting the kingdom into a monarchy for himself
> 2Ch 11:22-23 And Rehoboam appointed Abijah the son of Maacah to be chief prince, the leader among his brothers; for he intended to make him king. And he acted wisely and dispersed all his sons throughout all the lands of Judah and Benjamin, to all the fortified cities; and he gave them food in abundance and sought many wives for them.

## Indulging in sexual lust
> 2Ch 11:21 And Rehoboam loved Maacah the daughter of Absalom above all his wives and his concubines. (For he had taken eighteen wives and sixty concubines and begot twenty-eight sons and sixty daughters.)
