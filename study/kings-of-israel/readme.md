## Listening to God not to fight his brothers

# Abijah

## Being fundamental

> 2Ch 13:10-11 But as for us, Jehovah is our God, and we have not forsaken Him; and the priests who minister to Jehovah are the sons of Aaron, and the Levites are in their work. And they offer in smoke to Jehovah burnt offerings morning by morning and evening by evening as well as fragrant incense, and they set the rows of bread upon the pure table, and they care for the golden lampstand and its lamps that it may burn evening by evening; for we keep the charge of Jehovah our God, but you have forsaken Him.

## Trust in the Lord in the battle against Jeroboam

And Jehovah struck the Cushites before Asa and before Judah, and the Cushites fled.

> 2Ch 15:8 And when Asa heard these words, that is, the prophecy of Oded the prophet, he strengthened himself and put away the detestable things from all the land of Judah and Benjamin and from the cities that he had taken in the hill country of Ephraim.

I am now sending you silver and gold; go, break your alliance with Baasha the king of Israel, so that he goes away from me.

### Because the king of Israel had tried to prevent his people from going to Asa (to worship God?)

> 2Ch 16:1 In the thirty-sixth year of the reign of Asa, Baasha the king of Israel went up against Judah and built Ramah to prevent anyone from going out or coming in to Asa the king of Judah.
