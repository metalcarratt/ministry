# Abijah

## Being fundamental

> 2Ch 13:10-11 But as for us, Jehovah is our God, and we have not forsaken Him; and the priests who minister to Jehovah are the sons of Aaron, and the Levites are in their work. And they offer in smoke to Jehovah burnt offerings morning by morning and evening by evening as well as fragrant incense, and they set the rows of bread upon the pure table, and they care for the golden lampstand and its lamps that it may burn evening by evening; for we keep the charge of Jehovah our God, but you have forsaken Him.

## Winning the battle against the Cushites by trusting in Jehovah

> 2Ch 14:11-12 And Asa called out to Jehovah his God and said, O Jehovah, there is none besides You to help us, between the mighty and those without strength. Help us, O Jehovah our God, for we trust in You, and in Your name we have come against this multitude. O Jehovah, You are our God; do not let mortal man prevail against You. And Jehovah struck the Cushites before Asa and before Judah, and the Cushites fled.
