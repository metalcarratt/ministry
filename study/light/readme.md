# Light

> The lamp of the body is the eye. If therefore your eye is single, your whole body will be full of light; but if your eye is evil, your whole body will be dark. If then the light that is in you is darkness, how great is the darkness!
Matt. 6:22-23</cite>

> In Him was life, and the life was the light of men
John 1:4
