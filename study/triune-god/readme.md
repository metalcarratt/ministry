And He will thoroughly cleanse His threshing floor and will gather His wheat into the barn, but the chaff He will burn up with unquenchable fire**.

> Mt 3:14-15 But John tried to prevent Him, saying, It is I who have need of being baptized by You, and **You come to me**? But Jesus answered and said to him, Permit it for now, for **it is fitting for us in this way to fulfill all righteousness**. Then he permitted Him.

> Mt 4:6-7 And said to Him, If **You are the Son of God**, cast Yourself down; for it is written, “To His angels He shall give charge concerning You, and on their hands they shall bear You up, lest You strike Your foot against a stone.” Jesus said to him, Again, it is written, “You shall not test the Lord your God.”
