## Abolishing the Clergy System

Second, the clergy system must be abolished from our church life. The so-called clergy system is a group of people in Christianity who, after studying theology and receiving a theological education, come out to do the evangelical and ministerial work. In a typical Christian organization we can see a group of people who are the preachers, pastors, teachers, and choir directors. They are the clergy. Once these clergymen come to a meeting, all the other saints merely sit there passively. Related to the church, the saints do not have to do anything other than attend the meeting and offer money, because from the time they are saved, they are never taught to do anything.

According to the Bible, this practice is altogether against God’s desire. God desires all who are saved to be the members of the Body of Christ. The church is the Body of Christ, just as we have our physical body. This body has different members, and different members have different functions. If all the members of my body do not function accordingly, I will become paralyzed and numb; my body will not be a body anymore.

This is the general condition of Christianity today. Only the clergy is active in the meetings, and the congregation is inactive. Metaphorically speaking, the saints are not living; they have become numb. According to the Bible, we can never accept this. Therefore, among us we do not want the so-called preachers and pastors and other practices of the clergy system. We hope that some brothers and sisters will be able to serve the Lord full time, but this does not mean that being full time is their lifelong occupation. This year they may come out to serve the Lord full time, and after four years if they have the leading from the Lord and are willing to do something else, they can go and do according to the Lord’s leading. This is like the apostle Paul; although he was the greatest gospel preacher, he did not have preaching the gospel as his job. On the one hand, Paul preached the gospel, but on the other hand, he made tents with his own hands. He did not make tents for his own living only; he even labored with his hands to provide for the needs of those who served and preached the gospel with him ( Acts 18:3 ; 20:34 ).

According to the Bible, therefore, there is not a profession of “preacher.” We are now encouraging the saved college students not to go to work immediately after graduation but to spend one or two years learning to serve full time, if possible. On the one hand, they will endeavor in the learning of truth, getting to know the spiritual things, and on the other hand, they will be exercised in the matter of service in the house of God. If after two years, after they have been equipped in this way, they go out to get a job or do some business; this will be very good. Therefore, we truly hope that every brother and sister can be perfected and participate in some kind of service. Some brothers and sisters may feel that they can go full time right away; that would be the best. Some may feel that they can go half time and some one-quarter time, while some may feel that they can set apart their nights and holidays. These all serve the Lord; these are all good. In any case, we should all minister; we should all participate in some kind of service.

At this time there is a meeting in almost every home, and we very much encourage all who are saved in each household—the husband, the wife, the children, and the parents, every member of the household—to be active in the home meetings. For example, the little brother can call a hymn, the big sister can pray, the older brother can read the Bible, and the younger brother can say a little word. Everyone can function in a home meeting, building up one another. Of course, the new believers may not know very much, so some who have been saved for a longer time need to have a home meeting with them. This is not going to their homes to be their family pastor or their family preacher; it is to meet together with them as saints in the church.

We do not have preachers, we do not have pastors, and we do not have gospel giants preaching the gospel while others listen. We are simply a group of saints—some only eighteen, nineteen, or twenty years old accompanied by one or two older ones—going out together to knock on doors and visit people to bring the gospel to them. Thank the Lord, people are happy and willing to open the door and receive us. This is truly the work of the grace of the Lord. Therefore, we all need to see that there is no clergy system in our church life.

## PROTESTANTISM
### Practicing the Works of the Nicolaitans,the Works of the Clergy in the Religious Hierarchy

Protestantism practices the works of the Nicolaitans, the works of the clergy in the religious hierarchy ( Rev. 2:6 ). This is a strong sign of today’s Protestant churches. In the Protestant churches there is a hierarchy with the clergy and the so-called laymen. A small number are clergy, and the majority are laymen. If we practice this, we are not in the recovery.

We have to consider whether or not we have the clergy and the laity in our meetings. We may not have the term clergy,but in actuality we may be building up the clergy. As long as we insist on keeping the system of one man speaking without the proper practice of every member of the church prophesying, we are building up the clergy.

Brother Nee saw the truth concerning the church meeting in mutuality revealed in 1 Corinthians 14 in 1937. His ministry on this is in the book entitled The Normal Christian Church Life.In 1948 he spoke concerning this again in the book entitled Church Affairs.But throughout the years, we did not find a way to replace the system of one man speaking with all the saints prophesying. In 1984 I purposely went to Taiwan to restudy our situation in the recovery. In that study I was encouraged and strengthened by the Lord to pick up the practice of the church meetings revealed in 1 Corinthians 14 .

Eventually, starting from the church in Taipei, we gave up the practice of one man speaking on the Lord’s Day. Now we practice prophesying in the meetings by all the saints. We realize that we cannot do this in very large meetings, so the church in Taipei divided their three thousand attendants into a number of district meetings. Each district meeting has about fifty saints. Today many of the local churches are practicing the prophesying of all the saints instead of the Lord’s Day message meeting by one speaker.

In Revelation 2:6 the Lord Jesus said clearly that He hates the works of the Nicolaitans, the clergy-laity system (see footnote 1, Recovery Version). We need to reject anything of this system. All of us should be the functioning members of the Body of Christ. Wherever clergy and laity are, hierarchy is being built up. Such a system changes the nature of the churches in the recovery.

### Annulling the Functions of the Members in the Body of Christ

The Protestant churches annul the functions of the members in the Body of Christ. They maintain that to have one man speaking is better than to have all the saints function. They feel that having one man speaking keeps the meeting in a good order and ensures that a good word will be spoken to the attendants. They feel that a meeting left up to all the saints would end in chaos and confusion. By reading 1 Corinthians 14 we can see that Paul anticipated that the practice of all prophesying would not be so easy. This is why Paul charged them to do everything becomingly and in order ( v. 40 ).

We like to be becoming, but at the same time we do not like to be dead. Rather, we want to be living. I used to ask people, “What do you like better—Forest Lawn Cemetery or a playground?” A playground has very little order, but at Forest Lawn Cemetery everything is in order. We do not want to have church meetings that are like a cemetery. Our church meetings need to be very living. The book of Psalms encourages us to make a joyful noise to the Lord ( 100:1 ). We need such a joyful noise in our church meetings.

# SUB-SECTION THREE - PERGAMOS—THE CORRUPTED CHURCH
## Verse Fifteen

However, we have to know that the teaching of the Nicolaitans does not involve only a group of people uplifting themselves to a special position. We have to realize that this is something that the common believers prefer. If the ordinary believers object to this and consider this a loss of their right and a demotion of their qualification, such an unscriptural and damaging hierarchical distinction between the clergy and the laity will not prevail as it has. It is because the ordinary believers love this that the teaching of the Nicolaitans is allowed to prevail. The laity is grateful to the clergy because these professional ones are willing to replace the nonprofessional ones to bear the responsibility of all spiritual things. Since believers have lost their first love, they have long ago lost their taste for spiritual things. As such, they are more than willing for someone to come and take over everything. By calling themselves the laity, they consider themselves just the ordinary believers, which means that they cannot be blamed for being worldly! The world should not expect them to be too spiritual! God’s foreordained words were not only fulfilled in the Israelites but are also realized in the church today: “The prophets prophesy falsely, / And the priests rule by their own authority; / And My people love it this way” ( Jer. 5:31 ).

# CHAPTER TWO - ENDEAVORING TO CARRY OUT THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY 
## THE GOD-ORDAINED, SCRIPTURAL WAY TO PRACTICE THE CHURCH LIFE

I would like to point out three verses that are very crucial. Acts 2:46 tells us that the early Christians broke bread from house to house. The Greek text can also mean that they broke bread “according to their homes.” Acts 5:42 tells us that the early apostles went from house to house to do two things: to teach and to preach Christ as the gospel. Their gospel was not a theology or mere doctrine. Their gospel was a living person, the very Christ, whom the Jewish religion at that time opposed to the uttermost. They preached this opposed One as the gospel, and they also taught. These two verses are critical. Another crucial verse is 1 Corinthians 14:26 . This verse tells us that when the church comes together, each one should have something. This one has a psalm, another one has a teaching, another one has a revelation, etc.

By these three verses we can see the real situation and the real condition of the believers’ meetings in the early days of the church. This situation and condition cannot be seen in today’s Christianity. Even we ourselves are very short of this God-ordained way to practice the church life. First, the early believers practiced the church life according to their homes. This means that the church life at that time was in the believers’ homes. Second, when the whole church came together, it was not a meeting in which one person spoke and the rest listened. Their church meetings were full of mutuality. Each one should have something of the Lord to share with the others for the building up of the church. Such meetings of mutuality cannot be seen in today’s Christianity, and it is hard to see them prevailing among us. 

This is why by October of 1984, I was forced to reconsider what is in the Bible, what we are doing, and what we see in today’s Christianity. My eyes were once more enlightened to see God’s ordained way to build up the Body of Christ. Surely Christianity has deviated from this way. We also have deviated to a certain extent because we have not fully practiced what is recorded in the holy Word. Thus, I was strong to make a decision that we needed to have a great change, a revolutionary change.

The present practice of Christianity leads to hierarchy, organization, and clergy, producing many so-called laymen. Hierarchy, organization, and clergy are the factors that have killed and even cut Christ’s Body into pieces. Doctrinal factors have not done the damage that these three things have done. These three things depend mainly on the present practice of Christianity. If the present practice of Christianity is torn down, hierarchy falls apart, organization is gone, and the practice of clergy is buried.

Many years ago our brother Watchman Nee saw this clearly. I surely knew where he was. He had many talks with me. Actually, I learned these things through him. Since the time that Brother Nee shared these things, however, the Lord’s recovery has gradually and unintentionally drifted back in certain respects to the practice of Christianity. It seems that hierarchy, organization, and clergy, in principle, have begun to exist among us secretly. The way to uproot hierarchy, organization, and clergy is to fully abandon the practice of Christianity.

I think that the leading ones in all the different localities should have realized that the real situation among us has drifted back, to some extent, from the living Body of Christ to hierarchy, organization, and clergy. The way to pull down hierarchy, organization, and clergy is to kill the system of having big meetings with one person speaking and the rest listening. Then there will be no means to build up hierarchy. If we pull down this old system of meeting and meet according to homes, hierarchy will be gone.

Some may argue by saying that if we have many home meetings, the church will be full of confusion. My response is that it all depends upon how we have the home meetings. The Bible shows us that the home meetings are not for doctrines or organization but for preaching Christ and teaching Christ. The pattern in the New Testament reveals that in the home meetings they remembered the Lord by breaking bread, they preached Christ, and they taught what Christ did and is still doing. They ministered Christ to people. If we do this, there will be no standing and no ground for the enemy to come in to cause confusion.

In order to fully enter into the scriptural practice of the church life, the way ahead of us is very long. We are acquainted with the way to hold big meetings. We were raised up in this way, and this way has become a part of the “tissue” and the “cells” of our being. It is somewhat easy for people to establish a so-called church. They can build or rent a place to meet, collect some people together, raise funds, and hire someone to speak to them. But we must labor to learn the God-ordained, scriptural way to practice the church life because it is really new to us.
