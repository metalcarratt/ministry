# CHAPTER FIFTEEN - EXERCISING TO PRACTICE THE BODY LIFE

Today in any Christian group there may be two categories of people: the self-despising ones and the proud ones. Those who despise themselves think that they are nothing. As a result, they do not count themselves as part of the Body, and they do not function. The proud ones, to the contrary, consider themselves superior to others and seem to say, “I don’t need anyone else. I can do everything myself.” This combination of humility and pride is the source of the clergy and the laity. Those in the clergy class think that they can do everything and that they do not need others. But those among the laity think that they are nothing and that they cannot do anything. By means of this subtlety, the Body life has been killed. This is the reason we do not see the Body function in today’s Christian meetings. Instead, we see those in the class of the clergy doing everything. What a poor situation! Because we came from a background where there was the clergy and the laity and because we are still surrounded by this system today, we may not realize how ugly it is. Rather, we have been drugged to such an extent that we think such a situation is normal.

## EVERYONE NEEDING TO FUNCTION

In the meetings of the church everyone must function, including the young ones, the new ones, and the weak ones. However, thinking that it is a waste of time for those who are new, young, or weak to function in the meetings, we may say, “What can the weaker ones do? What help can be rendered by the new ones or the young ones? It is better for them to be quiet. Let them save the time for those who are able to do something.” Our thinking has been saturated with this concept. This indicates that we have been drugged and do not have a proper sense regarding the function of the members of the Body.

When I speak, nearly every member of my body functions. It is not true that only my mouth speaks and that the rest of the members have nothing to do. As my mouth speaks, my whole body participates in the speaking. For example, my hands make certain gestures, and my shoulders move. Every part of my body is functioning. I am not a machine with a speaking mechanism called the mouth. When a mechanical mouth speaks, the other parts of the machine do not participate in the speaking. Because my mouth is a living part of my body, my entire body functions whenever I speak.

Even in some meetings in the Lord’s recovery, the situation still is not normal. Instead, due to the background and influence of Christianity, the situation is quite abnormal. Again I say, with respect to the matter of the functioning of the members of the Body, we all have been drugged. The purpose of these chapters is not to give you doctrine; it is to minister a de-drugging word to you. All of us, including me, need to be de-drugged. I was born, raised, and educated in Christianity. Because of this influence, at times I have said, “These people are too young. They don’t have anything to share with the saints. It is better for them to be quiet in the meeting.” This concept is wrong. The Body moves with all the members. Thus, from now on we must pray, “Lord, grant that whenever we meet together we shall have the move of the whole Body.” What a difference it makes when all the Body moves!

Due to our religious background, we may have the attitude that a certain meeting is not our meeting. This is the reason some saints have said to me, “Brother Lee, tonight’s meeting is your meeting.” This means that I am the one to run the show. How much we have been drugged! There is no meeting that is the domain of anyone in particular. All the meetings, even the ministry meetings, are the meetings of the saints. If you say that a certain meeting is my meeting, I would reply that it is not only my meeting but also your meeting. Whenever we Christian brothers and sisters gather together, we are the Body. The Body is in our gathering. However, if we are not spiritual in a practical way in our gathering together, if we are not exercising the functioning spirit, the Body will not actually be found among us. When the saints gather together without being spiritual according to the exercise of their spirit, such a gathering will be a gathering of dumb idols. But if we come together exercising our spirit and ready to function, we shall be like players on a basketball team. Everyone will participate as a member of the team. Then we shall have the Body. We need to be rescued from the fallen situation of Christianity. In the Lord’s recovery we are being brought back to the beginning. In the beginning, when Christians came together, they all functioned. Today, however, we have been drugged. Thus, we all must exercise ourselves to function. Even the youngest ones and the weakest ones must also function.

## A CONSTITUTION OF ALL AGES

In his wisdom Paul touched the real problem of the practical Body life—the matter of the self-despising ones considering themselves inferior to others. Many of you still hold the concept that you are inferior to others. Moreover, some of the older ones think that they are out-of-date. Although they may not say this, such a subconscious thought is nonetheless within them. As you know, throughout the years my burden has been to promote the young people and to raise them up. This has caused some of the older ones to think that they are no longer needed. Hence, they have become deeply disappointed. Some of the older ones have said, “I have been in the Lord’s recovery from the beginning. Now it seems that, according to Brother Lee’s concept, all the older ones are through. He will not use the older ones on his team. We cannot learn the languages to go to Europe. In particular, we could never learn Hebrew to go to Jerusalem to have the church life there in preparation for the Lord’s coming back.” Because of this feeling of disappointment, some of the older ones consider themselves as only good for retirement. However, so many of the older ones are still eager to be trained. On the one hand, some older ones are disappointed; on the other hand, many older ones are still eager to be trained to be useful in the recovery. The Body is the Body. The young people are not the whole Body. Rather, they are simply part of the Body.

It is difficult for the older ones to contact young people on the campuses. If I, an elderly person, were to go to the campuses, the young people would not be interested in talking to me. People gather together according to age. For example, it is difficult for a child of twelve to play with a child of five. The five-year-old would prefer to associate with those of his own age. The same is true of the twelve-year-old. For this reason, the older ones are not useful for going to the campus to contact young people. The Body, however, is not composed only of young ones. Although the older ones are not suitable for work on the campus, they are the ones to bear the burden to pray for the young people. However, it would be very difficult for the young people to stay home and pray, because they are eager to get on the campus and contact people. The matter of praying for the work on the campuses is a function of the older ones.

I use this one illustration to point out that the Body is not composed of just one class of people. On the contrary, it is a composition of many age groups. The young people should be strong and aggressive to work on the campuses. But the older ones need to be very exercised to pray for the young people. Furthermore, the older ones can invite all the young laborers to their homes for dinner. However, if the older ones gossip and complain about being useless, our situation will be pitiful, and we shall not have the Body. But I believe that many will say, “Praise the Lord for raising up so many young people! The Lord is using them for the work on the campuses. Let us pray for them and let us do certain practical things to help them.” If this is the situation, the whole Body will be moving toward the goal of gaining this generation.

In all the meetings, including the meetings of the ministry, all the saints need to exercise together. If you are indifferent or dissenting while I am speaking, it will be difficult for me to speak, and my speaking will be weakened and lack weight. However, if you exercise yourself to function as a member of the Body and use your spirit and your whole being to participate in my speaking, my speaking will be strengthened and become weighty. It will not simply be the speaking of the mouth but the speaking of the Body.

## THE RECOVERY OF THE FUNCTIONING SPIRIT

In these days we have a definite goal. This goal is to carry out the Lord’s recovery. One of the main things to be recovered is the functioning spirit. We all, including the new ones, the young ones, the weak ones, and the old ones, need to be restored to the functioning spirit. Now is the time for us to come together to function. We all are players on the team; none of us is a spectator. If we gather together with the burden to function and with the attitude that we are players on the team, the meetings will be greatly uplifted, and the enemy will be driven away. Everyone who attends such a meeting will be subdued and convinced. The visitors will say, “How different this is from Christianity! This meeting is different from any kind of gathering I have attended before.” All the church meetings must be like this. It is not a matter of a good speaker; it is a matter of the functioning of all the members.

We all need to be recovered back to the functioning spirit, back to the genuine practice of being spiritual. To be spiritual is to exercise the functioning spirit. We need to be stirred up to hate our habit of not functioning. If you function even a little in the meetings, your spirit will be stirred up, and you will be nourished, strengthened, and refreshed. When you go home, you will realize what a difference it makes to function in the meetings. But if because you are so cautious you do not function, you will sense when you return home that you are lacking in inward strength. Furthermore, you will not have the sense of inner satisfaction. Functioning in the meetings has a great effect on our daily living. Whenever you function in a meeting, no matter whether the meeting is high or low, rich or poor, that meeting is rich to you. However, if you do not function in the meeting, that meeting will be poor to you. Whether a meeting is rich or poor as far as you are concerned depends on whether or not you function in that meeting. If you function, you will be strengthened, refreshed, and stirred up. But if you do not function, the meeting will not be meaningful to you. This can be proved in our experience. If we all function in the meetings, we shall all experience a rich meeting.

How good it would be if in our meetings there were no particular speaker, but every one was a speaker! People often ask who the speaker will be in the meeting. From now on, when you are asked about the speaker, you need to answer, “I am the speaker.” If the person does not believe you, tell him, “Come and see. I will stand up to speak, and I will speak especially to you.” We all must be prepared to say that we are the speaker in the meeting. How wonderful this would be! We need to drive away the old influence of Christianity from our meetings. We should have no clergy or laity but the functioning of all the members of the Body.

The functioning of all the members depends on two things. First, the inferior ones should not despise themselves or be humble; rather, they must learn to be aggressive. Second, the superior ones must learn to be limited. They should not think that they can do everything but should realize that they need others. If we learn these lessons, the Body will be tempered together, and there will be a proper balance. This is what we need for the genuine Body life.

Once, I was invited to a certain group that supposedly had the Body ministry. But what this group meant by Body ministry was to have several speakers instead of one. I told them that this certainly was not the Body. To have several speakers does not mean that you have the Body, for the Body is not made up of several members but of all the members. Consider how many members there are in your body. Eventually, that group began to realize that they did not truly have the Body ministry.

## ADORNING THE LESS HONORABLE MEMBERS

Let us now consider 1 Corinthians 12:22 and 23 . These verses say, “Much rather the members of the body which seem to be weaker are necessary. And those members of the body which we consider to be less honorable, these we clothe with more abundant honor; and our uncomely members come to have more abundant comeliness.” What are the members that we think to be less honorable and that we clothe with more abundant honor? As you consider your own body, do you know what members these are? Those members of the body that seem to be less honorable are the feet. In 1948 I was staying with Brother Nee in his hometown. At a certain point in our conversation, he said, “Witness, the more cultured people are, the more they adorn their feet. Whether your culture is high or low is indicated by the way you adorn your feet. You northerners have higher culture than the southerners. You never go around with bare feet. Rather, you beautify them with socks and shoes.” I replied, “Brother Nee, the northerners adorn their feet because the weather there is cold. The southerners may simply wear a pair of slippers because the weather here is usually very warm.” Brother Nee replied, “No, don’t say this. Even among the southerners, the highly cultured people do not go around with bare feet. They always spend money to beautify their feet.”

One day I was reading 1 Corinthians 12:21 , where Paul says that the head cannot say to the feet, “I have no need of you.” The head should not say, “Feet, because you are so low, I don’t need you.” Because the feet are so low, they need more adornment. Suppose I were fully dressed with a suit and tie but had no shoes and socks on. Would you not say that it was shameful for me to be barefooted? However, you would not consider it shameful for my head or my hands to be uncovered. This indicates that the feet are the less honorable members of the body. Because they are less honorable than the other members, we need to adorn them properly.

However, we often damage the principle of the Body by adorning the head with many “hats” but not caring for the lower members, the feet. We need to bestow more honor on the feet. From now on, in all the churches and in all the meetings we must learn to clothe the lower members with more honor. Do not buy more “hats” for the head. Instead, purchase “shoes” for the adornment of the feet so that you may beautify these less honorable parts of the Body.

## HONORING THOSE WHO SPEAK HALTINGLY

Today, however, we often follow the despicable practice of crowning the eloquent speakers with honor. Sisters admire eloquence. Certain sisters may place several crowns upon the head of an eloquent one. If I were an eloquent speaker and my speech were like music, the sisters would find it entertaining and would say, “Let us go to hear Brother Lee. His speaking is so pleasant.” All the sisters would purchase crowns for me. But suppose I spoke in a very halting way. Finding listening to me unbearable, everyone would want me to sit down. Instead of clothing me with honor, they would deprive me of whatever adornment I had for my uncomely feet. They would strip me in order to suppress me from speaking in the meetings. Nevertheless, we must thank God that He has brought so many halting speakers into the church. Which do you prefer—the head or the feet? Throughout the years of the church life in California, we have not spent a penny to adorn the head. However, we have spent a great deal to buy socks and shoes to beautify the feet. This is precisely Paul’s meaning when he says that the members that seem to be less honorable are clothed with more abundant honor.

We all need to learn to exercise ourselves as the Body. From now on, we should no longer regard eloquence so highly. Instead, we should honor those who speak haltingly. When you hear this, you may say, “Brother Lee, this is too difficult. Eloquence is so sweet and musical. But I cannot tolerate listening to halting speech.” If you cannot tolerate it, it is an indication that you are natural and not spiritual. In the Body life every member is needed. In order to have the church life, the Body life, we need all the members. The services in Christianity today are a form of entertainment. Both the singers and the speakers entertain the congregation. In the seminaries men are taught to speak eloquently and are taught how to attract people and to entertain them. What a shame it is to speak eloquently to entertain people! We are not here for this. Instead, we must either crucify people or resurrect them. Instead of entertainment, we have the experience of the cross.

## THE SPEAKING THAT EXPRESSES CHRIST

Eloquence does not express Christ. On the contrary, an eloquent sermon is a form of entertainment. If we exercise to have the practice of the Body, so many halting ones will begin to speak. If the members exercise their spirit to be spiritual and to speak for Christ, something of Christ will be manifested, although their speaking will not be eloquent. This is the Body. For the long run, we need meetings filled with speaking that is not eloquent, yet speaking through which Christ is expressed. This kind of meeting edifies the saints and builds them up. We all need a change of taste. We are accustomed to a diet of eloquence and musical messages. What we need now are words spoken haltingly that manifest Christ. I believe that this is Paul’s meaning in this portion of the Word.

## ELOQUENCE CAUSING DIVISION

According to our natural concept, we admire eloquent speakers. But to admire eloquence is to damage the Body. This is the reason that God has had to temper the Body together. I thank God that He has been tempering the Body. He has humbled the eloquent speakers, and He has raised up the halting ones to speak for Him in order that there should be no division in the Body. In today’s Christianity there is division everywhere. Most of these divisions have been caused by eloquent speakers. Every eloquent speaker will draw a group to himself. Those who admire various kinds of musical speech will gather around the eloquent ones. I do not appreciate such “music.” Instead, I prefer to listen to the little ones speaking in a halting way. We in the church life must no longer exalt eloquence, because the eloquent speakers create division and draw a following. In Christianity today there is a great deal of competition in speaking. Whoever is an outstanding speaker will have a large following. But this will cause a big division. This trend still influences the churches. Thus, we must rise up to oppose it and learn how to adorn the less honorable ones, the ones who speak haltingly. We need to say, “Praise the Lord for this brother! He speaks haltingly, but he has a life-giving matter to share with us. We wish to adorn him, beautify him, and honor him.” This is the Body life.

In these chapters I am not teaching you mere doctrines. I am passing on to you what I have learned through the years so that we may have the proper Body life. Suppose an eloquent speaker comes into the meeting. Will you still admire him? If you do, it means that there is no Body life. Rather, by admiring the eloquent one, you create a division and kill the Body. You will help to produce an atmosphere in which those who cannot speak well will be despised. We should not give so many crowns of honor to the eloquent speakers. Rather, we need to buy shoes to adorn the halting and stammering ones. We need to encourage the less honorable members to speak again and again. This will build up the Body life and establish the genuine Body ministry. In the long run, eloquent speakers damage the Body life, but the halting speakers build it up. This is utterly different from the practice in today’s Christianity, and it absolutely contradicts our natural concept. Nevertheless, for the sake of the proper Body life, we must all learn this lesson.

# CHAPTER TWO - ENDEAVORING TO CARRY OUT THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY 
## THE GOD-ORDAINED, SCRIPTURAL WAY TO PRACTICE THE CHURCH LIFE

I would like to point out three verses that are very crucial. Acts 2:46 tells us that the early Christians broke bread from house to house. The Greek text can also mean that they broke bread “according to their homes.” Acts 5:42 tells us that the early apostles went from house to house to do two things: to teach and to preach Christ as the gospel. Their gospel was not a theology or mere doctrine. Their gospel was a living person, the very Christ, whom the Jewish religion at that time opposed to the uttermost. They preached this opposed One as the gospel, and they also taught. These two verses are critical. Another crucial verse is 1 Corinthians 14:26 . This verse tells us that when the church comes together, each one should have something. This one has a psalm, another one has a teaching, another one has a revelation, etc.

By these three verses we can see the real situation and the real condition of the believers’ meetings in the early days of the church. This situation and condition cannot be seen in today’s Christianity. Even we ourselves are very short of this God-ordained way to practice the church life. First, the early believers practiced the church life according to their homes. This means that the church life at that time was in the believers’ homes. Second, when the whole church came together, it was not a meeting in which one person spoke and the rest listened. Their church meetings were full of mutuality. Each one should have something of the Lord to share with the others for the building up of the church. Such meetings of mutuality cannot be seen in today’s Christianity, and it is hard to see them prevailing among us. 

This is why by October of 1984, I was forced to reconsider what is in the Bible, what we are doing, and what we see in today’s Christianity. My eyes were once more enlightened to see God’s ordained way to build up the Body of Christ. Surely Christianity has deviated from this way. We also have deviated to a certain extent because we have not fully practiced what is recorded in the holy Word. Thus, I was strong to make a decision that we needed to have a great change, a revolutionary change.

The present practice of Christianity leads to hierarchy, organization, and clergy, producing many so-called laymen. Hierarchy, organization, and clergy are the factors that have killed and even cut Christ’s Body into pieces. Doctrinal factors have not done the damage that these three things have done. These three things depend mainly on the present practice of Christianity. If the present practice of Christianity is torn down, hierarchy falls apart, organization is gone, and the practice of clergy is buried.

Many years ago our brother Watchman Nee saw this clearly. I surely knew where he was. He had many talks with me. Actually, I learned these things through him. Since the time that Brother Nee shared these things, however, the Lord’s recovery has gradually and unintentionally drifted back in certain respects to the practice of Christianity. It seems that hierarchy, organization, and clergy, in principle, have begun to exist among us secretly. The way to uproot hierarchy, organization, and clergy is to fully abandon the practice of Christianity.

I think that the leading ones in all the different localities should have realized that the real situation among us has drifted back, to some extent, from the living Body of Christ to hierarchy, organization, and clergy. The way to pull down hierarchy, organization, and clergy is to kill the system of having big meetings with one person speaking and the rest listening. Then there will be no means to build up hierarchy. If we pull down this old system of meeting and meet according to homes, hierarchy will be gone.

Some may argue by saying that if we have many home meetings, the church will be full of confusion. My response is that it all depends upon how we have the home meetings. The Bible shows us that the home meetings are not for doctrines or organization but for preaching Christ and teaching Christ. The pattern in the New Testament reveals that in the home meetings they remembered the Lord by breaking bread, they preached Christ, and they taught what Christ did and is still doing. They ministered Christ to people. If we do this, there will be no standing and no ground for the enemy to come in to cause confusion.

In order to fully enter into the scriptural practice of the church life, the way ahead of us is very long. We are acquainted with the way to hold big meetings. We were raised up in this way, and this way has become a part of the “tissue” and the “cells” of our being. It is somewhat easy for people to establish a so-called church. They can build or rent a place to meet, collect some people together, raise funds, and hire someone to speak to them. But we must labor to learn the God-ordained, scriptural way to practice the church life because it is really new to us.

# [Book:] The Christian (2): Meditations on Revelation, CWWN, vol.4
# SUB-SECTION THREE - PERGAMOS—THE CORRUPTED CHURCH
## Verse Fifteen

However, we have to know that the teaching of the Nicolaitans does not involve only a group of people uplifting themselves to a special position. We have to realize that this is something that the common believers prefer. If the ordinary believers object to this and consider this a loss of their right and a demotion of their qualification, such an unscriptural and damaging hierarchical distinction between the clergy and the laity will not prevail as it has. It is because the ordinary believers love this that the teaching of the Nicolaitans is allowed to prevail. The laity is grateful to the clergy because these professional ones are willing to replace the nonprofessional ones to bear the responsibility of all spiritual things. Since believers have lost their first love, they have long ago lost their taste for spiritual things. As such, they are more than willing for someone to come and take over everything. By calling themselves the laity, they consider themselves just the ordinary believers, which means that they cannot be blamed for being worldly! The world should not expect them to be too spiritual! God’s foreordained words were not only fulfilled in the Israelites but are also realized in the church today: “The prophets prophesy falsely, / And the priests rule by their own authority; / And My people love it this way” ( Jer. 5:31 ).

# [Book:] The Mystery of the Universe and the Meaning of Human Life, CWWL, 1985, vol. 5, Chapter 6
## Abolishing the Clergy System

Second, the clergy system must be abolished from our church life. The so-called clergy system is a group of people in Christianity who, after studying theology and receiving a theological education, come out to do the evangelical and ministerial work. In a typical Christian organization we can see a group of people who are the preachers, pastors, teachers, and choir directors. They are the clergy. Once these clergymen come to a meeting, all the other saints merely sit there passively. Related to the church, the saints do not have to do anything other than attend the meeting and offer money, because from the time they are saved, they are never taught to do anything.

According to the Bible, this practice is altogether against God’s desire. God desires all who are saved to be the members of the Body of Christ. The church is the Body of Christ, just as we have our physical body. This body has different members, and different members have different functions. If all the members of my body do not function accordingly, I will become paralyzed and numb; my body will not be a body anymore.

This is the general condition of Christianity today. Only the clergy is active in the meetings, and the congregation is inactive. Metaphorically speaking, the saints are not living; they have become numb. According to the Bible, we can never accept this. Therefore, among us we do not want the so-called preachers and pastors and other practices of the clergy system. We hope that some brothers and sisters will be able to serve the Lord full time, but this does not mean that being full time is their lifelong occupation. This year they may come out to serve the Lord full time, and after four years if they have the leading from the Lord and are willing to do something else, they can go and do according to the Lord’s leading. This is like the apostle Paul; although he was the greatest gospel preacher, he did not have preaching the gospel as his job. On the one hand, Paul preached the gospel, but on the other hand, he made tents with his own hands. He did not make tents for his own living only; he even labored with his hands to provide for the needs of those who served and preached the gospel with him ( Acts 18:3 ; 20:34 ).

According to the Bible, therefore, there is not a profession of “preacher.” We are now encouraging the saved college students not to go to work immediately after graduation but to spend one or two years learning to serve full time, if possible. On the one hand, they will endeavor in the learning of truth, getting to know the spiritual things, and on the other hand, they will be exercised in the matter of service in the house of God. If after two years, after they have been equipped in this way, they go out to get a job or do some business; this will be very good. Therefore, we truly hope that every brother and sister can be perfected and participate in some kind of service. Some brothers and sisters may feel that they can go full time right away; that would be the best. Some may feel that they can go half time and some one-quarter time, while some may feel that they can set apart their nights and holidays. These all serve the Lord; these are all good. In any case, we should all minister; we should all participate in some kind of service.

At this time there is a meeting in almost every home, and we very much encourage all who are saved in each household—the husband, the wife, the children, and the parents, every member of the household—to be active in the home meetings. For example, the little brother can call a hymn, the big sister can pray, the older brother can read the Bible, and the younger brother can say a little word. Everyone can function in a home meeting, building up one another. Of course, the new believers may not know very much, so some who have been saved for a longer time need to have a home meeting with them. This is not going to their homes to be their family pastor or their family preacher; it is to meet together with them as saints in the church.

We do not have preachers, we do not have pastors, and we do not have gospel giants preaching the gospel while others listen. We are simply a group of saints—some only eighteen, nineteen, or twenty years old accompanied by one or two older ones—going out together to knock on doors and visit people to bring the gospel to them. Thank the Lord, people are happy and willing to open the door and receive us. This is truly the work of the grace of the Lord. Therefore, we all need to see that there is no clergy system in our church life.

# [Book:] The Overcomers, CWWL, 1991–1992, vol. 4, CHAPTER FOUR - TO OVERCOME THE THREE DEFORMED RELIGIONS
## PROTESTANTISM
### Practicing the Works of the Nicolaitans,the Works of the Clergy in the Religious Hierarchy

Protestantism practices the works of the Nicolaitans, the works of the clergy in the religious hierarchy ( Rev. 2:6 ). This is a strong sign of today’s Protestant churches. In the Protestant churches there is a hierarchy with the clergy and the so-called laymen. A small number are clergy, and the majority are laymen. If we practice this, we are not in the recovery.

We have to consider whether or not we have the clergy and the laity in our meetings. We may not have the term clergy,but in actuality we may be building up the clergy. As long as we insist on keeping the system of one man speaking without the proper practice of every member of the church prophesying, we are building up the clergy.

Brother Nee saw the truth concerning the church meeting in mutuality revealed in 1 Corinthians 14 in 1937. His ministry on this is in the book entitled The Normal Christian Church Life.In 1948 he spoke concerning this again in the book entitled Church Affairs.But throughout the years, we did not find a way to replace the system of one man speaking with all the saints prophesying. In 1984 I purposely went to Taiwan to restudy our situation in the recovery. In that study I was encouraged and strengthened by the Lord to pick up the practice of the church meetings revealed in 1 Corinthians 14 .

Eventually, starting from the church in Taipei, we gave up the practice of one man speaking on the Lord’s Day. Now we practice prophesying in the meetings by all the saints. We realize that we cannot do this in very large meetings, so the church in Taipei divided their three thousand attendants into a number of district meetings. Each district meeting has about fifty saints. Today many of the local churches are practicing the prophesying of all the saints instead of the Lord’s Day message meeting by one speaker.

In Revelation 2:6 the Lord Jesus said clearly that He hates the works of the Nicolaitans, the clergy-laity system (see footnote 1, Recovery Version). We need to reject anything of this system. All of us should be the functioning members of the Body of Christ. Wherever clergy and laity are, hierarchy is being built up. Such a system changes the nature of the churches in the recovery.

### Annulling the Functions of the Members in the Body of Christ

The Protestant churches annul the functions of the members in the Body of Christ. They maintain that to have one man speaking is better than to have all the saints function. They feel that having one man speaking keeps the meeting in a good order and ensures that a good word will be spoken to the attendants. They feel that a meeting left up to all the saints would end in chaos and confusion. By reading 1 Corinthians 14 we can see that Paul anticipated that the practice of all prophesying would not be so easy. This is why Paul charged them to do everything becomingly and in order ( v. 40 ).

We like to be becoming, but at the same time we do not like to be dead. Rather, we want to be living. I used to ask people, “What do you like better—Forest Lawn Cemetery or a playground?” A playground has very little order, but at Forest Lawn Cemetery everything is in order. We do not want to have church meetings that are like a cemetery. Our church meetings need to be very living. The book of Psalms encourages us to make a joyful noise to the Lord ( 100:1 ). We need such a joyful noise in our church meetings.
