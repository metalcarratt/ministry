God is sovereign but also merciful. 

## God's sovereignty

The sovereignty is very much a matter of the throne. Gods sovereignty is somewhat of a mysterious matter. But we can see it in light of his throne. Unlimited authority, power, and position. 

**Acts 4:24**, god was sovereign over the persecution of the sanhedrin.

**Daniel 4**. God gave nebuchadnezzar a dream, and Daniel interpreted it and gave him a warning. But the word did not affect him, so after 12 months, he was driven out. V32 until you come to know that the most high is the rulers of the kings of the earth. V34, he learns a great lesson. God is God. 

**Romans 9:19-20**, who withstands his will? Who are you to answer back to God? We all like to argue with God. We all argue with God. Our situation. Why don't you fix this? Joseph was one who understood God was sovereign. He feared God. "All things work together for good." (Rom 8:28) Joseph remained under gods sovereign hand and did not initiate anything. Let him initiate. Respect and honour gods sovereignty.

**Rom 9:21**, the potter. He is the potter and we are the clay. If we don't see this we live in unhappiness. See something different. If I could only change my situation. If we realise God is sovereign we can gain the benefit of rom 8:28? **Learn to join ourselves to Him so he can do what he wants to do. He wants to build the church. But our entering into that reality is not our initiation. It's up to his sovereignty.** This does not mean we do nothing. Rather our responsibility increases, but it has to comes under his kingdom.

**Rom 9:23** vessels of honour and vessels of mercy. Regardless of right or wrong, sinful behaviour, rebellion throughout the years, we were already chosen. We are vessels. Not a matter of behaviour or improvement but of filling the vessel with God.

**Ezekiel 1:26** the throne. Our submission to his throne takes place through our spirit. There is a sense of life within us ruling and reigning. This is the throne. But how much do we rebel? Many times the lord gives us a very direct feeling. Don't say that. But you go ahead. If we see that there is a throne and he is on the throne.

the throne is the center of the universe. The lords presence is always with the throne. To allow God to have the highest position in our Christian life. He has the position to reign in us. If you want gods purpose to be carried out through you you must be a person under gods throne. To claim authority over the saints indicates we are not under a clear sky. We should not try to rule over the saints. Humble ourselves under a clear sky. The authority is not mine, yours or others, it is the throne above a clear sky. None of us have any authority. Moses, when the people rebelled, did not exercise his authority but bowed down to God who has the authority. Then the Lord came in to vindicate. Do not take the natural human way to exercise any kind of authority. 

## "I will have mercy on whoever I will have mercy"

In light of our view of gods sovereignty our appreciation of mercy should be uplifted. He is sovereign, but he is also merciful. Matt 9:9-13. Gods mercy reaches not the righteous but sinners. Tax collectors, sinners, the poor, the blind, the lepers. These are the people he calls.the pharisees self righteousness was not getting them anywhere. A certain kind of humbleness is required. If you realise you are sinful, weak, needy, then you value God's mercy. We are dead in offenses and sins. The dead are in a hopeless situation. No matter how you think about yourself, you are dead in your offenses and sins. Rom 11:32, god has shut up all indisobedience that he might show mercy to all. 

If we know gods mercy we will not trust in our effort or be disappointed by our failures. Pray, Lord I need your mercy. We all are in need of gods mercy. if we open to God in this way he surely will bring us through.

Rom 9:14-18 God chose us and planned for us to believe, but he did not believe for us. We had to use our free will to believe. God hardened pharaohs heart to manifest his power. Thus even pharaohs' hardness was useful to God. The more we recognise gods sovereignty the more we will appreciate his mercy. 

The recipients of gods mercy are the pitiful ones, not the pharisees. Have you seen, tasted gods mercy? What might prevent us is a sense of self-righteousness. Laodecia. Pride in spiritual knowledge. Not recognizing our actual situation. May we be rescued and protected form every form of spiritual pride. The blind beggar, "Son of David, be merciful to me." May we learn to cry out, "Lord, have mercy on me!" When we touch this we will realise everything depends on His mercy. Our going on depends on His mercy.
