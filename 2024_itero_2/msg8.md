# preaching the gospel of the kingdom and disciplining the nations

It is one thing to know the dispensations.

There arose an appearance of the kingdom, which we can call christendom. It has its appearance but not it's reality. 

Just to know this is not enough. The kingdom is the realm of God. The divine and mystical realm. If you are not God you do not belong here. The only way for a human being to participate in this realm, is to be born into it. You have to acquire the life of God. Only by that way can you be in this realm. You have to be born anew. You have to be regenerated. This is life. How many people today see the kingdom in this way? Almost none. The essence of this kingdom is life. By being regenerated, aquiring another life, we receive the divine life, we have become a divine species. 

In this realm everything divine is here.

The kingdom of God refers more to the species of God than the reign of God, especially in John 3. Not just to enter another sovereignty or government but to become another species. John 3:5.

> Jn 3:5 Jesus answered, Truly, truly, I say to you, **Unless one is born** of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.

Help us appreciate the gospel, especially the gospel of the kingdom. We must be those who preach the kingdom gospel.

The sower went out to sow. What does this have to do with the kingdom? Where is the king? The king is in the seed. The plant grows according to the seed. The flowering, the bearing of fruit, all comes from this seed. This is the kingdom. The kingdom starts with a seed. That seed is Jesus Christ, the God man. The more this seed grows and develops, the more it propogates into more hearts and grows there, do you know what is coming into being? The kingdom of God.

The sowing of the seed Matt. 13:3

> Mt 13:3 And He spoke many things to them in parables, saying, **Behold, the sower went out to sow**.

The propogation and spreading of the seed Acts 6:7; 12:24; 19:20

> Ac 6:7 And **the word of God grew**, and the number of the disciples in Jerusalem multiplied greatly; and a large number of the priests obeyed the faith.

> Ac 12:24 But **the word of God grew and multiplied**.

> Ac 19:20 Thus, **the word of the Lord grew** mightily and prevailed.

The growth, development of the seed - 2 Peter 1:3-11

> 2P 1:3 Seeing that His divine power has granted to us all things which relate to life and godliness, through the full knowledge of Him who has called us by His own glory and virtue,
>
> 2P 1:4 Through which He has granted to us precious and exceedingly great promises that through these you might become partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption which is in the world by lust.
> 
> 2P 1:5 And for this very reason also, **adding all diligence, supply bountifully in your faith** virtue; and in virtue, knowledge;
> 
> 2P 1:11 For in this way **the entrance into the eternal kingdom** of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ will be richly and bountifully supplied to you.

The move of the divine trinity with the divine coordination shows us the harmony, beauty and excellency in the divine trinity and is an excellent and beautiful pattern that the head has set up for our coordination as members of his body; **today in the church life the body of Christ has not been built up adequately because of a shortage of the proper coordination**.
