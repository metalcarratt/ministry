The anointing, life, and peace, are indicators to keep us away from death, away from flesh.

We need a hidden life to kill the flesh.

If we live in the flesh we won't grow. The saints who grow outwardly do not grow in a healthy way. We need growth in a secret way.

Specific benefits of spending time with the Lord
- specific enlightenment (allow him the time and the ground to go deeper)
- specific encouragement (the lord knows how to sustain the weary with a word, isa 50:4)

God created the universe and then hid in it, to the point that those living in it would not know he made it. This is his temperament. God does countless things in our lives but he conceals himself.

1 kings 19
 
Sometimes we are trying to spend time with the Lord but there are so many thoughts. Maybe not bad thoughts, thoughts about the church, our burden, etc. But we have to learn to put our thoughts aside and listen in quietness. "My soul waits in silence before him". Our soul needs to be quieted. 'Surely I have calmed And quieted my soul." "Be still and know that I am god." Sometimes we just need to be still.

Psalm 46 the earth is quaking but we can be still and enjoy the streams that gladden the city of god.

When the lord met Mary after the resurrection she thought he was the gardener. The Lord met the two disciples on the way to ameas And they did not recognise him the whole way. This is the lords temperament. There is one book in the bible (esther) that doesn't mention god at all. 

"Shallow earth" - always guided by emotion and circumstances. Things can affect us, but not to the point they dishearten and discourage us. The Lord was like a tender plant in a barren place. The Lord never looked to his environment for sustenance, encouragement, supply. His roots went so far down they reached the heavens. He would always go away privately to pray. Jeremiah 17:7-8.

Whenever we see someone stumble, don't think it was sudden or accidental. Day after day of no roots.

Hezekiah showed the babylonians everything and then his people lost everything. We need to learn how to testify. Don't do anything secretly for self glory. Need to learn how to follow the inner anointing.

We should not think we can gain anything by simply listening to a message. We need to pay a price. In this case the price is our time. Take time to gain deep roots.
