# spiritual warfare to bring in the kingdom of God and living in the kingdom of the Son of God's love

As the age comes to an end there will be an intensification in spiritual warfare. My heart aches that there are thousands of saints who have not passed through the third stage, the experience of the cross applied to us experientially to the self, the flesh, the natural constitution. Because this third stage is so crucial. At the end of the third stage, with the cross deeply operating on our self, we will realise the life we have is corporate. Gradually there will be a body consciousness.

The kingdom of god will not come in gently. There will be warfare to bring it in. Satan does not want the power of the kingdom of God to be on the earth.

Conflict between the satanic will and God's will.  1 Peter - our will under God's government, that it would be in harmony with God's will. Lord, to what extent am I absolutely one with your will? When I look back over the past years, there were certain things that were not pleasant, but ... 

Christ fought for victory, we fight from victory. 

How much in the prayer meeting, or in a home meeting while praying, the prayer to bring the authority of God to the earth? If you abide in me and my words abide in you, ask whatever you will and it will be done. The lord is praying and then we pray his words as our prayer. Then he will take action. 

The kingdom of God will not come automatically; in order for the kingdom of God to come, there is the need of spiritual fighting. What will we do with words like this? 

The will of God is that the all-inclusive Christ be everything to me. In Ephesians the eternal will of God is to have the church. Now it's settled for us permanently. I'm here for God's perfect will to be done. And the focus of God's will is Christ and the church. Once this has been settled between us and the Lord, we can open and say, Father God, what is your will for me right now? One of the indicators of what His present will is for me, is it's not what I've been doing for the past 20 years, for my history. Matt 7, not everyone who says Lord, Lord will enter into the kingdom of the heavens but he who does the will of my Father in the heavens. "I don't know you. Depart from Me, workers of lawlessness." The time will come when the Lord will ask, what is the source of all you've done? What He is really saying is, it was all your own will.

The kingdom is absolutely a matter of God's will. So if we are doing God's will we are living in the kingdom. 

> Mt 12:36 And I say to you that every idle word which men shall speak, they will render an account concerning it in the day of judgment.
> 
> Mt 12:37 For by your words you shall be justified, and by your words you shall be condemned.

Do we really know the condition of our church?
- The prayer meeting - is it really a prayer meeting?
- The Lord's table meeting - is there anything more than singing hymns. Do we come empty handed or with hands full of Christ
- The prophecying meeting - is there prophecying? Or 90% speaking?

The center of everything we go through in our daily life is that Christ would have the first place in all things.
