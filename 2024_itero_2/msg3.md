The kingdom and the church cannot exist without each other.

The church is christs increase in life, the kingdom is his increase in administration. Administration is related to the decisions we have to make, the actions we have to take. The Lord lived on the earth as a man, but also stood for gods purpose in his administration. The exercise of gods authority.

The most basic element of the gospel is the kingdom. John the Baptist came to announce the kingdom and the lord Jesus came to do the same thing. Most people consider the gospel to be about sin, forgiveness and heaven. But in the NT the gospel is connected to the kingdom. Needed to bring the rebels back to God. Man became fallen mainly because he became rebellious, fallen from the proper position he had with god. Man's main problem is not sin but rebellion against God. Need to be brought back to gods rule and reign through gods light.

The kingdom is a realm not only of ruling and reigning but of life. This kingdom is a life kingdom. 

For life to develop, it needs to be in a proper realm. For example the human life would not be able to develop very easily on the moon. The kingdom is the reality of the church. The church should bear the characteristics of the kingdom. What is our view of the church? Just a place for some saved ones to gather and have the lords table meeting? It depends on whether there is the reality of the kingdom. 

Two conditions for a church to exist. 1) the authority of the holy Spirit. 2) the ground of locality. When watchman nee started breaking bread there were only three of them. But when they broke bread the authority of the spirit was poured out. There may be a thousand in a locality but no authority of the spirit. Then that is not a genuine church. We must respect the headship of christ. No one can establish a church without the heads hip of christ.

In the nj the city and the temple are joined. The building of the temple is through our enjoyment and flowing out of the riches of life, but the city is needed as the protection of the temple, to guard the temple from attacks.

There was not as much of a battle when Ezra went back to build up the temple, but there was a fierce battle when Nehemiah went back to build up the wall. The enemy will attack, belittle, so that the work will cease. Our work is to rebuild the city. This is our responsibility.

The victory has been won by christ. We are one with the victorious head, fighting from victory.

The prayer meeting is the war room. Prayer is the weapon we yield against satan.
