The word of the cross. The application of the cross is vitally necessary for the building up of the church.

"I will build my church" - the greatest prophecy. Just declare it. "The gates of hades shall not prevail against it." The greatest opposition to the building of the church is because of these gates. These gates are not closed, not locked. You can unlock the gate, and you can also lock the gate. "I will give to you the keys of the kingdom of the heavens." For sure, Peter used these keys to open the gates of the gospel to the Jews on the day of pentecost and to the gentiles in the house of Cornelius. "Whatever you bind on the earth shall have been bound in the heavens, whatever you loose on the earth shall have been loosed in heaven." Immediately after the matter of the building of the church is unveiled, the matter of spiritual warfare is unveiled. The battle between the church being built and these gates of hades. What about the gates of hades, the source and power of death? This is the place of satan. Death is how he rules. There are gates where death can come out. The kingdom of darkness. Death is the power satan uses to fight against the church. "From that time, Jesus began to show to his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem" right after talking about the building of the church, the gates of hades, the keys of the kingdom, the need to bind and loose the church, he revealed he must go. That was the only pathway for the building of the church. "To suffer many things... and be killed, and on the third day be raised." You want my church to be built? I will build my church, but in must go to Jerusalem. This shows the lords death and resurrection are the unique way to build up the church. The church is not built up by your gift, charissa, knowledge, organization, worldly mean. The church is built through crucifixion and resurrection. I must go and die and be raised. The same Peter who saw and exlaimed something no other mortal could. That Peter, who received revelation from the father, who had been given the keys. This Peter took the lord aside and began to rebuke him. You should be crowned, you should be king. God be merciful to you. The audacity of a natural man. When we are living in our natural life we are audacious. We can say anything. We rebuke we overstep, we talk about things we don't know about. At that instant this Peter was living in his natural life. A natural man with a good heart. He loved the lord. You can't die. This shall by no means happen to you. " but he turned and said to Peter, get behind me satan." Dear brothers, at that moment, this Peter is no longer a stone in resurrection, this man has reverted back to his natural life, exercising his natural mind and emotion, and he became one with the devil. I can be the devil, in a moment. No joke. I'm speaking to myself. One moment we see great things, another moment we are caught by satan. To do something "good." "You are a stumbling block to me for you are not setting your mind on the things of God but on the things of men." The mind set on the things of men. "If anyone wants to come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me." The self that needs to be denied. "For whoever wants to save his soul life shall lose it but whoever loses the soul life for my sake shall find it." Need to lose the soul life. Satan, mind, self, soul. These three things joined together are actually satan in action. Over time the church has been subject to persecution, attack ,heretics, evil teachings, the world, as a kind of direct attack from satan. But this morning we are talking about satan from another direction. That direction is more subtle. It is you and i, like Peter. Who can be transformed into satan. To hinder, frustrate the lord, from building his church.

(Matt 16) the church and gods enemy revealed.

The word, the utterance, of the cross. Everywhere Paul went this was his gospel. To the unbelievers foolishness, but to us who believe the power of god.

Satan came out of the gate of Peter's self. Three gates: the natural mind set on the things of men; the self, the I; the soul life.

Shut the gates, even lock the gates. Three keys for locking. 1) denying the self, 2) taking up the cross, 3) losing the soul life.

#### denying the self

Before eve ate the fruit she had already eaten the thought of satan. The thought is key. Even the littlest thought we need to be aware. If we allow it to fester the more it will grow. The more you think, the more you are right, justified. These are how these gates work. 

The mind, where the thinking, the imagination takes place. What is opinion? A very strong belief and thought that you have cultivated, welcomed, developed.

The self is independence from God. We should depend not only on God but also on his body, the brothers and sisters. If we are independent from the body we are also independent of the lord. We must treat and honour the body as we treat and honor the head.

When we are dependent the self is gone.

If the self is locked up the church will be built up. Locked up, built up.

#### taking up the cross

The sinless lord Jesus, just because he was human, had to practice to deny the self.
