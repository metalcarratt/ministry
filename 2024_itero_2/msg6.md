# Being watchful in life and faithful in service

Matt 24, 25. Life and service, particularly in view of the kingdom. 

Life is so we can minister life to others. So life is for service. But service must be full of life. 

## for life we need oil

How much spirit is there in your mind, in your thinking. How much in your emotion, in your love or hate? How much in your will, your decisions? We live our life we are living in our soul. How much have we allowed the spirit to penetrate into our mind, emotion and will. How much does the throne have a place in our soul. 

"Buy" indicates paying a price, such as giving up the world, dealing with the self, loving the lord above all, and counting all things loss for christ.
The paying of the price happens in all the ordinary things of our human life. Pay the price to gain the lord. Need to be in this mindset. Whatever I'm doing, to gain the lord while carrying on all the sundry things. 

Belshazzar was king of Babylon, he made many riches, but he was weighed in the scales by God and found to be lacking (dan 5:27)

12 points on how to pay the price:
1. Love the lord above all. See how precious, how priceless christ is.
2. Count all things loss on account of christ. 
3. Enjoy the lord in his word every day
4. Deal with sins thoroughly
5. Abide in fellowship with the Lord daily and hourly
6. Redeem our time to be saturated and soaked in the word
7. Be watchful for our prayer life
8. Be filled in spirit, speaking in psalms, giving thanks
9. Not grieving the holy spirit by speaking corrupt words but words of grace.
10. Not quenching the spirit, always rejoicing, unceasingly pray, in everything give thanks
11. Do all according to the mingled spirit
12. Be filled with the bountiful supply of the spirit.

## for service we need the talent, the spiritual gifts

The gift is the spirit becoming your ability. The spirit needed for the building up of the church. Not natural talent or capability. This gift is from your enjoying the spirit, the spirit increasing in you to give you a gift. Properly speaking we need to aspire the proper spiritual gifts. The gift which is out of the enjoyment of the spirit. If we are not filled with the spirit in our spirit our service is just a work. These two matters, our filling of the spirit must be matched with our spiritual gift.

Whatever we do, whether shepherding or visitng the saints, etc, must be out from him and to him.

A tendency, especially when we know how to do something, to do it on our own. Not needing the lord or the body. We become independent. This is why the churches have an elder*ship*. Submit yourself to the fellow elders around you. Have no trust in your self. Learn to carry out the lords service in a coordinating way.

Not bad to have this aspiration, to speak in every meeting, not out of eloquence but for the ministering of christ as food to the saints.

The one talented slave put his talent under a bushel, something for his living. As we work to make a living we need to be careful that our making of a living does not nullify our gift, for example by consuming all our energy so that we have no energy or time left for the church.
