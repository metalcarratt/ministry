# Message Eight - The seed of David becoming the Son of God

David had the heart that God would have a dwelling place on earth. He intended to do everything possible to build it. Nathan said very good. But God manifested Himself and had him speak a prophecy through typology. There's a typology referring to Solomon but Solomon becomes a type referring to Christ in His Kingdom. God says, You will have a son. I will call him My son and he will carry out the building.

I need to point out something very important to us. It involves a sequence in the lives of believers that we will either follow or not. If we do we will received Christ, grow in life, be built up and become part of the bride. If we do not we will be depriving ourselves of experiencing the all-inclusive Christ.

Eph. 1, 3, the prayer in chapter 1 is the prayer for revelation, for the veil to be lifted, for the light to shine, for the truth to enter into us and for us to see the divine things. We realise it on the level of vision. In chapter 3 Paul prays a prayer for experience. God strengthening us with power through His Spirit into the inner man. If we don't have much interest in learning, knowing, "I've heard this many times". I remember one brother referred to brother Lee's recent speaking and he dismissed the whole thing, why do we have to learn all these complicated things. In this case it didn't lead to a very positive end. The proper knowledge comes first, then experience follows. 4:13, until we all arrive at the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God. What does that mean? To have the full knowledge of God is to have a realisation of the revelation concerning the Son of God *for* our experience. We have a realisation, we have a consciousness of it, we are aware of it. That leads to the experience of Christ. I don't believe any of us would ever say, "I have arrived at the full knowledge of the Son of God". Only God knows where we are. This is even a corporate matter. The more we arrive the more our oneness is deepened. Based on this in Phil Paul said (3:8) I also count all things to be loss. Everything precious to me is trash, dung. I suffer the loss and call it waste. On account of the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus. Let's be very clear. Not the knowledge of the excellency, but the excellency of the knowledge. This again refers to revelation, vision. He is now making a comparison in his own history. All I devoted myself to I count as nothing. I just want to arrive, count all things loss, for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ. v10, to know Him. This is the experientially knowledge. And the power of His resurrection, fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death. First we need the lifting of veil, that gives us the divine knowledge of the Son of God. This knowledge opens the way for us to experience Him. A few decades ago He put in my heart the longing to know Him. I want to know, in the first step, by vision, by revelation. I want to know, in the second step, by experience. This entire message concerns the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus our Lord. The entire outline is really not focused on me or you. On your desire to grow in life, on your desire to become an overcomer. We need to receive grace to be lifted out of our occupation, longing, whatever, and just give the next hour to learn what the ministry has opened up in these verses in roman numeral I.

## I. "I will raise up your seed after you... I will be his Father, and he will be My son" - 2 Sam. 7:12a, 14a

"Your seed" refers literally to Solomon, David's son. But Solomon typifies Christ reigning in His kingdom.

David's seed is *actually* Christ. Our growth in life, our real experience in Christ, depends very much on knowing and realising the difference between the firstborn Son of God and the only begotten Son of God. It's a blessing for us to have the opportunity to advance a little toward the full knowledge of the Son of God.

## II. In Matthew 22:41-45 the Lord Jesus asked the greatest question in the universe, "What do you think concerning the Christ, whose son is He?" - v42a

The scribes, Pharisees, lawyers would come one at a time with challenging questions. They were all subdued. They were amazed at His wisdom. Then He asked them this question. What do you think concerning the Christ? Whose son is He?

The Pharisees said Christ was David's son. That was correct. From the first verse of Matthew He's called the Son of David. You have to pay attention to this expression.

How could David call Him Lord if He is his Son? David called Him Lord.

We have to read the Word with a clear mind with a heart of love, pursuing the Lord, with an exercised spirit. But just to have the doctrine will not take us very far. Christ can be known by us only in our spirit, through God's revelation. That's why Paul prayed that the Father would give us a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the full knowledge of Him.

In His divinity Christ is the Lord of David, in His humanity, Christ is the Son of David.

## III. In Revelation 22:16 the Lord Jesus said, "I am the Root and the Offspring of David"

What kind of person could be both? He had to be a God-man. In HIs divinity Christ is the root, the source. In His humanity, Christ is the Offspring, the issue of David. This is amazing. This is the most unique person in the universe.

Christ Himself acknowledged here that He is both human and divine, both God and man.

## IV. In Acts 13 Paul said that from David's seed "God, according to promise, brought to Israel a Saviour, Jesus" (v23) and that "God has fully fulfilled this promise...in raising up Jesus, as it is written in the second Psalm, 'You are My Son; this day I have begotten You.'" (v33)

John emphasised the only begotten Son. In his first epistle he emphasised this even more. We cannot over emphasis this. Eternally, in the Godhead, He is the only-begotten Son. God so loved the world that He gave His only-begotten Son. This was a sacrifice. To be out propitiation offering for us. What love is this? But there's the second aspect, crucial to Paul's ministry. He's preaching the gospel in Antioch. He is proclaiming Christ as the first-born Son. Why is he doing that? Because as the only-begotten Son He cannot be propagated or reproduced. Eph.1:5, in eternity past, before anything was created, no angels, no nothing, God predestinated us unto sonship. This involves a lot. The only-begotten Son become a human being known as 'Son of Man'. We will see how the only-begotten Son became the firstborn Son and opened the way for there to be millions of sons to fulfil God's predestination.

In the gospel, what are we trying to do? Just save a person from the lake of fire? But what about preaching the gospel so that the firstborn Son can be multiplied. Surely the Lord has chosen people in North Korea, in Iran. Surely the gospel must reach them, so they can be born again and become sons of God. God had chosen Paul to know His will, see the Lord's face and hear words from His mouth. He received direct revelation. He was just constituted with the OT verses. The light shines on verse after verse. Maybe he was leaping with joy. I must proclaim this to all the gentiles.

### A. God fulfilled the promise by raising up Jesus

### B. Resurrection was a birth to Jesus

If I were asked to speak a class to a seminary and asked when was the son born they would say, what a simple question. His incarnation was when God become a man. But don't you know there's another birth? He was born in His resurrection to be the firstborn Son. That means others will be born. God fulfilled His promise by raising up Jesus.

We have been predestinate to be conformed to the image of the Son of God that He might be the firstborn among many brothers. This is where we come in. The firstborn Son will make each one of us a duplication of Himself. We are all His "twins". But in order for this to happen, He had to go through a process of death and resurrection to be begotten in His humanity with His divinity to be the firstborn Son. He is in us now as the prototype reproducing Himself. WE should have this prayer, that we would all be conformed to the image of the firstborn Son. Saved from self likeness, self expression. All conformed to the image of the firstborn Son of God. He would be the center. He is the firstborn and we are His multiplication.

Heb. 1:6, And when He brings again the firstborn into the inhabited earth

When God sent His only begotten Son He came alone. There was no-one like Him. When He comes again He will come in the status of the firstborn Son and He won't be alone. Don't you want to be there? The firstborn is coming to claim His inheritance, the whole earth, and He's not coming alone.

### C. Paul saw the Lord's resurrection in Psa. 2:7, "You are My Son, today I have begotten You"

Our brother Paul received this directly from the Lord. Paul applied the word 'today' to the day of the Lord's resurrection. Christ's resurrection was a birth. This chapter is so crucial. I found this book on Acts 13. The author had many interesting and helpful things to say but no vision. He got his PhD, you write your dissertation, some company publishes it as a book. That's far different than receiving revelation from this little man from China. 

That was His birth. That was also our birth. The Lord is not bound by time and space. On that day, to the dear woman Mary, asking where He was, He made Himself known to her. I ascend to My Father and Your Father. Go tell My brothers. How can the only-begotten Son have brothers? He can't, but the firstborn Son of God can. So we all have the same birthday.

### D. Incarnation - only-begotten Son put on humanity; resurrection - born of God as the firstborn

### E. In His resurrection we were also born to be the many sons of God

He's Immanuel. We can't see Him but He's here. He's here in our midst as the firstborn Son. Lord, we recognise and honour You as the firstborn Son. Here we are, some of your sons, going through the process. Thank You Lord, for the price You paid to become the firstborn Son.

This needs to be more than just a teaching to us. In our personal history what happened then is applied to us.

In the eternal marriage we will worship our Husband because He is God.

I received a request from a co-worker in another part of the earth and asked if we could have some fellowship by zoom. He wanted to share and know if I could genuinely confirm what he was saying. He said something like this, I realise I'm god in my spirit. Brother Lee uses this term, little 'gods'. Of course we're not God in the Godhead. But we're not mere humans anymore. We are Godmen. Right now, the firstborn Son as the Spirit is in our spirit. Our spirit is Zoe. It is life itself. The brother knew he would not be God in the Godhead. When I knew who my dad was, it was so clear. We have the same nature, the same life, similar characteristics. We have been born of God and we are becoming man-God. But it stops. We are not an object of worship. If He does not have people like this, He can only be on the throne and millions of people will be there in a big crowd worshipping Him, but no marriage because no match. When the Lord comes first He will come first secretly as the Bridegroom for His bride. His wife has made herself ready. There will be rejoicing in the universe when it's declared the bride as made herself ready. The components of the bride are the many sons.

## V. We need to know Christ in His resurrection designated as the Son of God in power with His human nature

This kind of knowing is a combination of knowing by revelation and knowing by experience. This is not something you just learn. This is real. Not just a theory or a doctrine. He has been designated the Son of God in His human nature. How is He designated? Raised from the dead by the glory of God. In the kingdom the co-kings won't need to say, by the way I'm a Son of God; no it will be very clear. This is our destiny.

### A. Before incarnation Christ was the Son of God

### B. Still needed to be designated the Son of God in resurrection because He had put on humanity which had nothing to do with divinity

2 Cor. 5, I long for a transfigured body. Don't be surprised if this sense gradually rises up in you. I don't do exercise to have muscles and buff up. Exercise is to stay alive. But a new body is coming.

Eventually our humanity will be uplifted through resurrection. But it has to take place first inwardly. That's why the dealing with the nature constitution is so crucial. Lord, I don't want to remain in my natural constitution. I don't trust what I have in my natural constitution. I want to be brought into resurrection. Your wife will be a resurrected person. I don't want to be belated becoming a resurrected person. Do what you need to do. Go where you need to go in me. Touch what you need to touch. Save me from my natural constitution. I want to be part of the prepared bride.

Resurrection itself is the power. If the Lord is operating in you as you're opening to Him and the power of resurrection operates, it will become evident to others who have discernment. This is not the natural person I knew 30 years ago. On the one hand you're the same, on the other hand you're not the same. This is the effect of resurrection sonizing us. The Lord will never discard the God-created humanity. In resurrection He's uplifting the God-created and redeemed part of our humanity. The goal (Phil. 3) is to attain to the out-resurrection. I hope this is a personal goal in you. I want to experience a reconstitution now. Don't let me go through another year. By the end of 2022 gain much more ground in me. Gain in so many saints. We are aware of some who have not grown for 20 or 30 years. It is not too late. Lord, give them the experience they need to be brought into resurrection before their journey is over. You can do a lot in a short period of time. But it needs people who are actively open to Him for this.

### C. In resurrection He became the Son of God in a new way

If we want the Lord to come back, He's coming for the bridge. She's made *herself* ready. This is an aggressive, acting cooperation to make myself ready. To make the wedding garment ready. The building, the oneness, the beauty of Christ wrought into us, ready. We just exercise our spirit, open our heart to the Lord, pray for this. God's will and purpose is to multiply His firstborn Son.

### D. According to the Spirit of Holiness

The life essence within the Lord Jesus. He had this essence within Him. Now we have this essence within us. Generally speaking, one characteristic of the Lord's recovery in the US is shallowness. I real lacking in depth. I'm so thankful when brother Lee was speaking from Eph.3 about the dimensions. Length, breadth, height and depth. The spiritual essence that touched the depths. The Lord wants to touch the depths of our being. We don't even know where they are or what they are. We can't see it. Through faith. It's this spirit of holiness.

The power of resurrection is manifested by the essence of life. This will activate the power of resurrection. That's why we need to live before the Lord as truly open vessels to Him. You search the inward parts of the heart. I want the essence of the divine light to saturate and permeate my entire being. I pray this for my spouse, for my brothers and sisters, the saints in the church, on the earth. You must have this. Our Christian life cannot be just a routine.

What happened to Him will happen to you and me. It's just a matter of when. Resurrected human nature. Transformed human nature. Uplifted human nature. Glorified human nature. Designated human nature.

### E. Connect Rom.1:3-4 and 8:29

8:29, Because those whom He foreknew He also presdestinated to be conformed to the image of His Son that He might be the firstborn among many brothers.

Saved from self-likeness. The highest oneness is the oneness in the divine glory. No self expressed anymore. Only God in Christ expressed through everyone. That is the oneness He prayed for. Rom. 5:10, much more we are being saved in His life. He might be the firstborn among many brothers. Look. Look at all the reproduction of the firstborn Son.

Rom. 1:3-4, Christ is the prototype. 8:29, mass-produced.

In Romans there is a deep divine thought related to this message. God becoming man and man becoming God. 8:3, God sent His Son in the likeness of the flesh of sin and concerning sin that sin may be condemned on the cross. This is God becoming man. 1:3-4, the seed of David, becoming the firstborn Son in resurrection. I fear for those who disregard the high peek of the divine revelation. This is the first aspect of the new revival. The high peak of the divine revelation leads to the God-man living and the universal shepherding. What a price, what a journey God took when He sent His only-begotten Son to die on the cross at 33 and suffer in a way we could never know. So that in His resurrection we would be born in Him. Now it's our own turn. God causes all things to work together for good. Lord here we are. Thank You for making this known to the minister of age. He official released this in 1994. The attack came right during that conference. He had to miss some of the meetings. The fight continues. When this truth dawns on us, now we can align ourselves with this intention. Now the firstborn Son is the prototype within us making us His mass reproduction. What a glory to Him. And the Bride will make herself ready. We are living for this.

Lord, we hardly know what to say. We want to thank You for the price you paid, to lay aside the splendour you had, you paid such a price as the man of sorrows, and you poured your blood out on the cross for our redemption. You released the divine life within you. In your resurrection you become not only the life-giving Spirit but the firstborn Son. How can we not respond and say we love you now in a way we could not before. God so loved us that He gave His only begotten Son. Lord, you so loved us that you gave yourself up as the sin offering on the cross. Now it's our love that originates in the love of God. We just ant to tell you We turn to you, open our whole being to You. Give all of us all the experiences we need to be conformed to the image of the firstborn Son during our days on the earth that we may be part of the bride who has made herself ready. Lord, you're coming for her. She is a composition, a corporate person of all those conformed to your image. Lord, keep on saving us in life day by day until we have been conformed to the image of the firstborn Son and are ready for rapture and designation of son in glory.
