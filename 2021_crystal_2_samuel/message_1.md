# Message One - The Central Thought of and the Divine Trinity as Revealed in 1 and 2 Samuel

A crystallization study is not a review of the life study messages. Not re-speaking certain messages. A crystal (regarding the Word of God) is the intrinsic significance of a crucial point in the Word. Not something necessarily on the surface. Need to be reading with the Word of God as the light. Saul with his monarchy is not a crystal. But the way Samuel functioned as the acting God is a crystal. Based first upon the Bible. This time on 1 and 2 Samuel. Then based on the life-study that opened up those books. But the crystals identified in a certain book requires the rest of the Bible for it's development and full presentation. Then also many aspects of the ministry. For example message 2 will be on the prayer ministry of Hannah. There will be a focus on her and her prayer. But that matter is a crystal developed all the way through to the end of the Bible.

The emphasis is on the Divine Trinity revealed in 1 and 2 Samuel. The Divine Trinity is the structure of the entire Bible. It may not be on the surface. "Let Us make man." That implies the Divine Trinity. "The throne of God and of the Lamb"; "The Spirit and the Bride say come." 

Three helpful words: cooperation, kingdom of God, Divine Trinity. These are the pillars in message one.

## I. The central though of 1 and 2 Samuel is that the fulfilment of God's economy needs man's cooperation-the principle of incarnation

The principle of incarnation - God enters into man and mingles with man to make man one with Himself; thus God is in man and man is in God, having one life and living. Samuel was such a person.

Deeply impressed - the fulfillment of God's economy requires out cooperation. Not *their* cooperation. *Our* cooperation.

To cooperate with God means to be bound together with God. God chooses to be bound together with us. We say, "Amen, we would be bound together with You." It's inseparable. God will bring us gradually to the point this will become our normal living.

​	positive example - Hannah, Samuel David

​	negative example - Eli, Saul

I was impressed during the last two rebellions. Here was brother Lee, faithfully cooperating with God. And here was another brother was was outwardly in this coordination. How we need grace to keep us in this cooperation.

It is interesting that God begins with a woman, with Hannah. There's an underlying principle here. When the Lord has a great need and is ready to take a significant act, He needs the sisters to be the channel. So when things are down, when they are low, and the Lord wants to move. Like it was with Hannah. It was still the age of Judges. But the Lord began with *her*. When things are going very well the enemy will first attack through the sisters. How crucial are the female believers to God's economy!

We look to the Lord for His mercy that our life would become a positive illustration, not a negative one.

God wants to build His dwelling place. Even more, He wants to bring in the kingdom to the earth. This is what both Hannah and Samuel, along with David, were used to accomplish.

What does God want to bring in among us and to the whole earth? Establishing God's kingdom. This is a crystal in itself. Samuel was used for a dispensational change, to bring in the God chosen king and to establish the kingdom of God. That is the goal. God must have on the earth His kingdom where He can express on the earth HIs glory and accomplish His will. Today the practicality of the kingdom is the church.

The good land, when it's enjoyed, to a certain extent, that enjoyment becomes the kingdom of God. That's how the kingdom is brought in. That is how we, in Christ, will turn the age and bring in the kingdom of God. It is the issue of enjoyment. I'm refreshed with the thought of the connection between the enjoyment of Christ and the coming of the kingdom.

We need to enjoy Christ. God needs us to enjoy Christ. How do we know the kingdom is coming? It's reigning in life. "Those who received the abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness will reign in life", "The kingdom of God is righteousness, peace and joy in the Holy Spirit." It's not just righteousness and peace that gives us the consummate realisation that we are in the kingdom. It's joy. Brother Lee's final written testimony was, "I have maintained my joy." This is the kind of cooperation we need. Bound together with Him and He with us. In this cooperation we labour together on the good land to enjoy Him. Then we will have the realisation, this is the kingdom of God. Lord, come. Your kingdom come. Now the Lord can answer it manifestly, because it has already come in us.

## II. We need to see the Divine Trinity as it is revealed in 1 and 2 Samuel

You won't find the word Trinity, but this is the structure of the whole Bible. The structure, the framework. Illustrated by the steel girders in a building. When the building is completed you don't see the framework. The Divine Trinity in the OT is exactly the same as the Divine Trinity in the NT. In the NT the unveiling of the Divine Trinity is clear. Baptised into the name of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit. In the OT it is portrayed mainly through typology.

### A. God's purpose - for God's people to set up a kingdom in the land

God needs a kingdom, a sphere, in which He is expressed in order to have His intention. How can God be expressed on the earth if everyone everywhere is in rebellion against Him. He must have on earth a group of people learning to cooperate with Him. His eternal purpose is to have a corporate expression. But in order for there to be this expression, there must be a realm in which He can be expressed. In the coming age that will be the whole earth. We're looking forward to this, that wherever you go the co-kings are there, the glory and expression. Eventually God will need a new heaven and new earth to have a proper container for the full expression.

The goal is the kingdom. Matt. 1, the genealogy. The names of so many kings. Do you remember the expression, "David, the King"? The was His goal, but He doesn't work alone. He works in the principle of incarnation, this cooperation. God finally found it in Samuel and in his father and especially mother. Why do we have our allotted portion? Why do we bring what we laboured? For the kingdom. Seek *first* His kingdom.

### B. An urgent need for one like Samuel

At the time of the beginning of 1 Samuel, God had an urgent need. When something is urgent you don't wait. And desperate. Eventually we will touch it, especially in prayer, in the prayer of the Body. We will touch this. Don't be bothered if we don't have this kind of sense yet. This word is to open up what is ahead of us.

Samuel was the last judge representing God's government. Nazarite, priest, prophet, judge. Qualified Samuel to be the one who would bring in the kingdom. The Lord's eyes are everywhere, looking for this. A corporate person. The one who could bring in the kingdom. First the King, Christ Himself. Wouldn't that be an indescribable joyful blessing, if you were standing before the judgement seat and the Son of Man says, "Your life was a factor in bringing Me, the King, to the earth. You, with many others, brought in the King with the Kingdom. Come in to the wedding feast, and you will be a co-king." That would give meaning to my whole life. We are doing this for God. Even not for a reward. This is for God.

Three verses in 1 Samuel 8,

> and they the people said to him now you are now old and your sons do not follow in your ways. appoint now for us a king then to judge us like all the nations. (but we want our kind of king, we want to be like them, our kind of king, our preference) but the matter displeased Samuel when they said, give us a king to judge us. then Samuel prayed to Jehovah. And Jehovah said to Samuel, listen to the voice of the people according to al that they have said yo you for it is not you who they have rejected for they have rejected Me from being king over them.

What a contrast we will see between David and Saul. What Saul wanted to do was to have a monarchy for himself and this children. He set up a pillar in honour of himself. He had a dreadful ending. Then the Lord moved, because He had Samuel as the channel. Led David through years and years of opposition, suffering, dealing, all in preparation to be king. At the beginning of the NT the mention is, the Son of David. Revelation, I'm the root the offspring of David. It's not enough for us to want some kind of kingdom. We have our concepts of what the king should be. We don't want to be like the children of Israel. I will fight any tendency to change the nature of the Lord's recovery to make us similar to organised Christianity.

### C. The bringing in of the Kingdom and King relied on the Divine Trinity with His people

Without the Divine Trinity bringing forth Samuel, if it were not involved with his mother and her prayer and consecration, there would have been no Samuel. No Samuel, no kingdom.

A detailed fine revelation of the Divine Trinity.

### D. Some indicators of the Divine Trinity in 1 Samuel 1

- the offerings signify the Christ we experience and bring to offer to Him
- the house of God is Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God
- these are God's embodiment and God's redemption

The Lord opened the scriptures, opened the eyes and opened the mind, of the two disciples after His resurrection.

This was the Divine Trinity enabling Hannah to pray, enabling Samuel to be brought forth and raised up.

**Key point:** Hannah was **forced to pray a desperate consecrating prayer**, motivated by God secretly, she prayed for a man-child who would be absolute for the Lord. There was another wife who had children, who would mock her. She wanted to be a mother, but the Lord would not answer her ordinary prayer. She matched her prayer with God's move and intention. "If you give me a son, I will consecrate him to be a nazarite." The Lord linked normal understandable need. The Lord wasn't playing around, discipling her. He realised if he waits long enough, she will be uplifted inwardly and her prayer will turn the age. Without her there is no Samuel, and without Samuel there is no kingdom.

### E. Triune God fully involved in bringing forth Samuel and David

The anointing of David:

- the oil typifies the Spirit
- the heifer typifies Christ as the offering

David's song in 2 Samuel 22:1-3

- crag, fortress, deliverer, rock, shield

2 Samuel 23:1-3:

- the rock is Christ
- the Spirit
- God is Elohim, the Triune God

2 Samuel 24:25:

- burnt offerings typify Christ for God's satisfaction
- peace offerings Christ for peace between God and His people

## III. Our present situation and God's need today are the same in principle as the situation and the need in the time of Samuel

Why our sovereign God allowed the enemy to bring in a pandemic to the end of a second year. He is sovereign. I don't dare give any idea. But we are in a degraded chaotic situation and we know from Matt. 24 and Luke 17, "As it was in the days of Noah, so will it be with the coming of the Son of Man." Just doing this and that and then the flood came. 

God has a need. We are living in the same principle, only much more difficult.

An urgent need for some to pray prevailing prayers for God's goal as Hannah did; for qualified ones live Samuel who was a nazarite, priest, prophet and judge. How does our involvement begin? With an urgent need of prevailing prayers.

A life-study of revelation, and angel with much incense added to the golden bowls which are the prayers of the saints. He adds the incense to make the prayers acceptable to God. Then the throne reacts in a powerful way.

**Key point:** We don't want an emotionally stirred up prayer.  When more opposition is stirred up and there are some who are standing. I believe there will be groups of sisters throughout the earth, praying this kind of prayer. Then there needs to be Samuels. This combination of Hannahs with her prayer and Samuels with his function, will bring in the king. Lord, You are the King. You are our King. We want You as the King with the Kingdom, to descend to the earth. The first thing is this kind of prayer. It will deepen. What will happen if there are groups of vital praying saints throughout the earth. The Lord will say, how? Where's the channel, the landing spot? **The Hannahs and Samuels?**

We are nearing the end of this age. Samuel was the transition of the age of the judges to the age of the kingdom. We want to be those who enable to Lord to do something even greater than that.

Lord, who me what it means to cooperate with the Divine Trinity. I pray that my fellow brothers and sisters would have this heart. We're ready, we're given to You. This study is to touch God's heart. His urgent need right now. Our opportunity to become the channel He needs.

**Key point:** We need to realise how greatly **the Divine Trinity is needed** to pray prevailing prayers and bring in the kingdom. It's not possible for us in ourselves to pray like this. We need Him. He will transmit His burden, His feeling into us. Without these kind of prayers no amount of messages will bring in the kingdom. May there be married couples and groups of saints, that through them these prevailing prayers would be offered to bring in the kingdom.





main point

The divine trinity created an environment to stir up hannah to prayer prayers that brought in Samuel and the king. The existence of the offerings and the house was a provision for hannah to be in a position where she could bring her desperate situation to the Lord in prayer and that he prayer could match God's need for a nazarite.

Qs

1. why does the fulfillment of God's economy need our cooperation, the principle of incarnation?
2. For what reason and for what purpose was there an urgent and desperate need for someone like Samuel?
3. Describe the Divine Trinity as revealed in 1 Samuel 1
4. Why is it crucial for us to see that the Triune God is involved with us today?
