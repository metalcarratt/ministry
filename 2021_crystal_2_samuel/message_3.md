# Message Three - Spiritual Principles, Life Lessons, and Holy Warnings Seen in the History of Samuel

We are coming now to the story of this famous person Samuel. As I was preparing, reading the story of Samuel, with the help of this outline, I began to have a deeper and wider appreciation of the history of this person. This story is not just a story for young people or children. It is a history that offers many spiritual principles. Please remember these three phrases: spiritual principles, life lessons and holy warnings. Coming from this angle I have a new appreciation of how applicable this history is to each and everyone of us. These principles, lessons, warnings, are needed by us today. God is seeking a people that would be today's Samuels, today's age turners. A collective man. So that God can carry out His move in our age today, in our times. They must learn these principles, these lessons, receive these warnings. There is a process, a necessity. If we are to be such a person, useful in God's hands for the outworking of His economy, we need to be perfected, to be trained, to learn. Lord, make me, make us, a Samuel of today. Make us that corporate acting God on the earth today.

**Roman numeral I**, the law of the Nazarite. **II**, how God in His wisdom and foresight established such a law of the Nazarites. **III**, how Samuel grew up under the custody of Eli. Samuel as a boy still grew up under his custody to learn, to minister to Jehovah. For us to serve the Lord, we need to go through a learning process of how to minister to God. **IV**, how Samuel turned the age into the age of the kingdom. **V**, Samuel's entire being and person was altogether according to God, one with God in every way. Brother Lee called him the acting God on this earth. Brothers and sisters, do we not aspire to this? To be God's true representative on earth today? **VI**, God began a new age by raising up this Nazarite-Priest. **VII**, Samuel as the acting God on earth ministered in five noble and high statuses.

## I. Samuel was of the tribe of Levi but not of the house of Aaron, the family of the priests ordained by God; Samuel ministered to the Lord as one who was a priest not by birth but by the Nazarite vow. [ the law of the Nazarite ]

It was God who initiated the situation and put the prayer in the heart of this woman. So that she would pray according to God's need and God's economy, for a son, for a male child. Nothing was accidental here. It was all purposed by God. This Samuel was of the tribe of Levi but not of the tribe of Aaron. He did not have the right bloodline to automatically be a priest. The house of Aaron is the only family of the priests ordained by God. Samuel ministered not as one born in the house of Aaron, but as one who was a priest by the Nazarite vow. Samuel can actually be traced back to the rebel Korah. He was a descendent of a rebel. There were sons of Korah who did not die with Korah. Because they didn't join the rebellion they were spared. In God's sparing of Korah's descendants, it was on the one hand because of his unlimited mercy and grace. On the other hand He was preparing for someone who would be used by Him eventually.

Samuel's mother consecrated him even before his conception. He was already given to the Lord to be a Nazarite. Pray for your descendants. Pray. I'm a product of the prayer of someone in my family. I know it because I heard her praying. Not only for my salvation but that I would serve Him my whole life. I'm very grateful for that. It was God's mercy and grace, even to raise up such a Hannah to pray in such a way.

God desires all His people to be Nazarites. Not just some young people. Not just a few. To be sanctified, separated, absolutely to God. To be totally, completely, existing for God's satisfaction, to meet God's need. We all need to be today's Samuel.

If you just study religion, church history, it is a terrible situation today in Christendom. Who are the overcomers? The Nazarites. Those who stand against the tide of degradation. Brothers and sisters, this is a call. We need to make this vow. We need to be happy and determined. This vow is something absolutely by free will. Because you volunteer God opens the door to you to become a real priest.

The first thing in this law of separation is that he abstains from all kinds of earthly pleasure and enjoyment. We know, if we are before the Lord, what is the earthly enjoyment and pleasure. We must not be usurped by these earthly enjoyment and pleasure. Christianity today is basically the earthly enjoyment with a cloak on it. In place of enjoying the things of the earth, we would be one who would enjoy Christ as our pleasure. Give up the world, Christ to obtain.

The second sign of a separated individual is that his head will not be shaved. That means this is a person wholly subject to a kind of headship. Wholly in subjection, in subordination. Always one who is under authority. The ultimate authority in this universe is simply the Lord Himself.

Not only to Him directly, but to the deputy authorities He would appoint, whether in society or in the church life. God today is a God of authority. In this universe, to work out His economy, He was a divine government, a kingdom. God would not only rule and reign directly, but also he sets up his deputies. To rule on His behalf. We do well to learn to submit to the Lord's established authority. To have any kind of rebelliousness would disqualify us from being a Nazarite.

Third, someone who would cut off all the natural affection. The Lord said, who is my mother, brother, sister. He was there only for the Father's business. We must overcome the natural affection.

Fourth, separated from death. Read the ministry about the death. Someone close to us may "die suddenly" (spiritually), injected with some poison. Someone could be your friend, your comrade, a family member. Even though *you* did not die, because you are so close you become defiled. So you have to go into some days of cleansing to re-establish your vow again.

The main thing we need to be separated from is all kinds of death. Death is many times more dirty, defiling, in the eyes of God than sin. If you touch death you need to go through the steps again.

## II. At the time of Samuel the priesthood of the house of Aaron was utterly fallen; God, however, foresaw the situation; besides His ordaining the house of Aaron to be the priests, He made a supplement-the Nazarite vow in Numbers 6-in case there should be an inadequacy in the ordained priests

God needed someone but there's no-one of the main line available to Him. So He opened the side door. Samuel was lent to the Lord by his mother. Now, God had someone.

We are surely in abnormal times. God has a need. The whole situation is degraded. God's house is poor. His administration is in want. Will you not stand up and meet His need? And offer yourself willingly, voluntarily, and lend yourself to the Lord. Their consecration will be like the womb of the dawn. Young brothers and sisters, give yourself to the Lord. This world will be gone. All the future, riches, vanity will be over. The side door is opened for us to come through.

## III. Samuel grew up under the custody of Eli, in his youth Samuel ministered to Jehovah before Eli, being taught by Eli the way to minister to God.

He ministered before Jehovah as a boy with a linen ephod. He was a baby priest. Under Eli he continued to grow up and also under his mother's support. He grew up in stature and favour both before Jehovah and before men. A lot of this is due to his learning under Eli. When Jehovah came to speak to him, Samuel at that time was sleeping in the temple, right where the Ark was. That was where this little boy slept. Where God was. God came to him and stood there and called, Samuel, Samuel. Brothers and sisters, don't stay in the outer court. At least be at the golden incense altar. Be there, sleep there, be close to the Lord, so He can speak to you. The main thing Samuel picked up under Eli was how to hear God's word. How to receive the Lord's speaking. A priest is one who would receive God's speaking and then give the same speaking to God's people.

### A. Samuel learned to listen

Lord, I am here, I am listening. Learn. Lord, I am here. Speak. I'm here to listen. The important thing when we go to the Lord is not to speak but to hear. When that slave decided to serve his master forever he was brought to the doorpost and a hole was bored through his ear. He would just listen to his master his whole life. We need to have an open ear. We need to be in a position to hear God's speaking. Mary received the better part, sitting there to hear the Lord.

The rhema words, the Spirit words the Lord would speak in a timely way to us. Our work depends on His commands. It would be presumptuous to us to do anything without His commands. Learn to listen. Open my hear and give me a word that I can feed and supply the needy. This is the position of a servant of God. Lord, my life, my services, wholy depends on Your Word. In those days it says the Word of God was rare. Because of this decrepit priesthood. But not to this Samuel.

### B. Samuel observed the deterioration of the priesthood

What is rebellion, what is ambition, what is impurity. There were live situations I observed. In whatever situation we can all learn something.

At this time Samuel was not the prophet he would become. There was another man of God who spoke to Eli about the fate of his whole family. What Samuel spoke confirmed that word.

God knew the training Samuel needed to go through.

All the things that happened became a warning, even to us today. These are the holy warnings that we need to heed.

## IV. Samuel was one who turned the age into the age of the kingdom with the kingship; this was a great thing not only in the history of Israel but even in the history of mankind.

The lesson to be learned here is, we need to follow Samuel not to be in haste. Not to stage a rebellion or a coo. Samuel was submissive. As long as Eli was there he remained under his authority. Samuel did not become what he was by a revolution. He left that to God. God arranged the environment to perfect him and build him up so he could be an age turner. In His perfecting hand, you don't need to hurry Him up. He will arrange situations in the environment. You don't need to manipulate. You don't need to be political. You don't need to do anything. We just need to be under the King, submitted to Him.

Not rebellion, not revolution, but revelation. Young brothers and sisters, stay away from death and stay away from rebellion.

## V. Samuel's whole being and person, not just his doing, living and work, were according to God; Samuel's being and God's heart were one; for this reason we may say that Samuel, a man according to God, was the acting God on earth.

Do you aspire to this? God needs the Samuels today. Samuel had nothing to live for, nothing in his future or aspirations. It was all whatever was in God's heart. He was just existing to carry that out. How pure! How absolute! How separated and sanctified this person was. We just know God's heart, we just want God's heart. Not my preference, not my desire, not my intention. Let all those be discarded. Only what is in God's heart. God eventually found this in David. David was a man according to God's heart. Here was a Priest-Prophet according to God's heart. Here was a King according to God's heart.

The king needed supervision, help, support, observation. Samuel would be that one. Going before God's anointed.

Lord, I'm in your perfecting hand. Take your time to perfect me for your economy. Not to make me someone great. No but perfect me uniquely for Your economy's sake.

Samuel said this, "As for me, far be it from me that I would sin against Jehovah by ceasing to pray for you." What a heart for God's people. He would consider not praying for God's people a sin. I recall Moses, Daniel, praying on behalf of God's people before God. Why pray for God's people? No matter what condition they are in, they are God's treasure, God's peculiar treasure. God made a covenant with them.

Samuel's environment was not an easy one. Don't wait for a good environment to be perfect. Now is the time. In whatever environment, in whatever situation. We need to care for God's interest and turn the age. In whatever situation our heart is for God and His people, the church.

Much like the Lord Jesus in Matthew 5-7 He gave the constitution of the kingdom of the heavens to us. Today if we want to live in the kingdom of God we need to know the by-laws and constitution. Go back to the life-study and study these things. Samuel did this. He was not the king. But he provided the by-laws and the constitution.

## VI. God began a new age in raising up Samuel, a young Nazarite, as a faithful priest to replace the degraded priesthood

The Urim and Thummim were the way for God to speak to His people. The speaking, the Word, was what was needed for God's people. Samuel was the real beginning of the Prophethood. He brought in not only the kingdom but the prophethood. The prophethood is needed to supplement the kingship.

To prophecy for the Lord is not a small thing. It is in God's speaking that He leads us. God want everyone to be a prophet. We all should be Nazarites. We all should be the priests. We all should be the prophets. Today, God must recover this in His recovery.

## VII. Samuel was one with God on earth; as the acting God on earth, the representative of the very God in heaven to rule over His people on earth, Samuel ministered in five statuses:

- Nazarite
- Priest
- Prophet
- Judge
- A man of prayer - the intercessor that God needs

1. Describe the Nazarite vow
2. How was Samuel taught by Eli the way to minister to God?
3. Provide the reasons why Samuel could be considered the acting God on earth.
4. Explain the five statuses in which Samuel ministered as God's representative.
