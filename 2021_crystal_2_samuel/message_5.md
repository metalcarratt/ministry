This is a serious but crucial message. The war with the Amalekites, which is a type of the flesh. The dealing with the flesh. I don't know when was the last time a message like this was given or heard. Concerning the matter of dealing with the flesh. 1 Samuel 15. Saul was charged by God to have war with the Amalekites. A lot is exposed here. A lot is revealed here for our learning. This is something very serious. It's a message that we need to exercise not only our spirit but also a sober mind to understand. 

We will see the significance of the flesh as typified by the Amalekites. We will see Jehovah's hatred toward the flesh, how much He hates the flesh. Jehovah would have war with the flesh from generation to generation. We will see the way to deal with the flesh. Finally we will see the consequence of us not obeying God's word to deal with the flesh.

## I. First Samuel 15 is a record of Saul's disobedience in his conquest of the Amalekites

Saul was anointed to be king back in chapter 9, just a few chapters before. Since then he had conquest over two enemies, the Amonites and the Philistines. This is the third conquest. But in this third conquest Saul was utterly exposed. He won the first two and even the third. But in this third conquest he was exposed - who he really was. On the one had defeating the enemies but on the other hand something within him was exposed that he was disobedient to Jehovah's word.

### A. Conquered but disobedient

Here's a case of Saul serving, making conquest, defeating the enemies, yet altogether disobedient to God.

### B. Exposed then given up by God and Samuel

You must read this chapter, maybe several times. Just to be impressed with the record here. If you just read it lightly, you may not be that impressed. You may think, what's wrong with Saul? Exposed:

1. spared Agag the king of the Amalekites
2. spared the best of the flock, sheep, oxen, under the cloak of making a sacrifice to Jehovah
3. went to Carmel to set up a monument to himself

He was proud of himself. When Samuel was sent by God to confront Saul, Saul argued and reasoned with Samuel. I did what Jehovah commanded me. I defeated all the Amalekites. Then of course, Samuel was very strong toward him, Jehovah would not accept your sacrifice, he wants your obedience. Saul asked for Samuel to honour him in front of the people and called God, *your* God. He really thought what he did was not wrong. When we come to the matter of the flesh we all have to realise how subtle it is. What's wrong with what I'm doing? People are being helped. People are being saved. Some churches are being raised up. Wouldn't God be pleased? This is a most serious lesson. More than just a lesson. It touches not only certain aspects of God, it touches God's throne, God's administration.

### C. Important lesson

## II. In typology, the Amalekites signify the flesh - the fallen man

### The leading enemy frustrating us

The Amalekites were relatives to the Israelites. Esau and Jacob were twin brothers. Amalek was a descendant of Esau. Amalek was the first enemy to come fight with Israel out of Egypt. This was the first battle. The first enemy that came to fight after being delivered from Egypt was Amalek. God would never forget this. I want to bring this people to my good land. But here is an enemy, the first enemy that tried to frustrate God from bringing His people into the good land.

The goal of the flesh is to frustrate God from attaining His purpose. Out to kill, out to destroy.

Ambition, pride, competition. All these are the different manifestations of the flesh. The flesh has destroyed so many lives, so many dear saints, so many dear servants of God. Certain things in the flesh rose up, in disagreement, in dissenting, trying to assert themselves, eventually finding themselves going against God. The flesh is not something to play around with. It is out to destroy. It is out to bring in frustration. It would destroy God's people, both in our Christian life and church life. 1 Pet 2:11, we need to abstain from fleshly lusts which war against the soul. The fleshly lusts war against the soul.

Exo. 17:16, For He said, for there is a hand against the throne of Jah. Jehovah will have war against Amalek from generation to generation.

Joshua fought the warfare and he won. But it was not over.

Gal. 5:17, the flesh lusts against the spirit, and the spirit against the flesh.

This thing is ongoing. It's a perpetual war. Until the Lord comes back. This Amalekite, the flesh, is still with us and will never change. No matter how spiritual, loving we are, our flesh is the same as before we got saved. Jehovah will be against this flesh.

### B. totality of the fallen old man

Three definitions:

- the fallen body, the corrupted body (Rom. 6:6, 7:24), the body of sin, the body of this death. Our physical body created by God but later on degenerated to become flesh
- the totality of the entire fallen human being (Gen. 6). Not just the outer body, the entire man
- the good aspects of man (Phil. 3:3-6). Some could serve God in the flesh. The flesh can do something for God. There is something good. But that doesn't mean it is acceptable. Something religious.

This message focuses on the second definition. The totality of the fallen being.

Old man, the self, the flesh, the "I". These different names but look similar.

- old man - our person, fallen person
- "I" is the name of this person. We call this old man "I". "I" have been crucified
- This "I" has a soul life. This is the self. The life of the fallen man. When this soul life expresses itself in opinions, that is the self. When the soul life acts to express it's viewpoint and opinion is the self.
- The flesh is the living out of the old man. That flesh includes the self when expressing opinion.

The flesh is the totality of the fallen being in expression, in action. The old man being lived out.

Rom. 8:7 the mind set on the flesh is enmity against God. Would you want to be God's enemy. We are sinners, committed sins, transgressed against His holiness. But to be an enemy is something else. You are someone opposing God. The flesh is at enmity with God. Paul said it is not subject to the law of God. No ability.

In Saul's case he thought he was doing God's will. Outwardly he was winning the victory. He thought he was having a great accomplishment. But inwardly he was God's enemy. He was trying to establish his own empire, his own kingdom. He established his own monument to remember himself. He seemed to be doing something for God but he was actually God's enemy.

You cannot improve it, you cannot change it. It will not be subject to God and has no ability to. No matter how much Samuel tried to persuade Saul, Saul just could not. To be subject to God is an impossibility. Outwardly Saul may say I have sinner, forgive me, but inwardly was no change. He cannot submit. Irreconcilable.

### C. The camp of God's enemy

Satan's work needs a base. What is this base? Man's flesh. Everything Satan tries to do, using the world, using sin, he works out of the base of the flesh. This is Satan's camp. Sin, the world and Satan camp here in the flesh. If that base is removed from Satan, he cannot act. Sin would be over, the world is without attraction and Satan has no power. We need to have a fear of the flesh. Because it is the camp of Satan.

Hymn 415 by A.B.Simpson. This hymn is not just about the self, it is about the flesh. There is this enemy within us called the flesh.

Practically speaking God's enemy is you, your fallen flesh. Peter, exercising his self, a branch of his flesh, was one with Satan, when telling the Lord not to go to the cross.

This flesh has to be crucified by us. Exo. 17:16, God would have war with the Amalekites. In very 14 it says Jehovah asked Moses to write it down as a memorial in a book and recite it to Joshua, I will utterly blot out the memory of the Amalekites. Deut 25:19, God's people need to blot out the memory of Amalek from under heaven. You should not forget.

Can you see how serious this matter is? God does not want to see this thing perpetuating. There is this war going on for centuries. Who talks about this? Care about this? Understands about this?

### D. A hand against the throne of the Lord

Not just to cause a little trouble. We are talking about an opposition, a rebellion.

Isa 14 describes this cherub who had fallen had become Satan. Five times, "I will" I will sit on my throne. I will ascend above the heights. I will make myself like the most high.

Paul was so strong to rescue the saints from the keeping of the law because the keeping of the law promotes the flesh. The flesh needs to be repudiated. Whatever is of the flesh is at enmity with God and is against God's throne.

If we are not in the person of Christ Satan may take advantage of us. 

### E. vs kingship



## III. what they did to Israel

Moses and Aaron on the mountaintop. Joshua in direct battle with the enemy. Moses on the mountaintop signifying the ascendant Christ at the heavens interceeding for us. That is only one aspect of Moses' type. Also typifies us. We are the ones who also need to correspond to Christ's intercession. We need to join in to that intercession. Moses' hands became tired, heavy. The ascended Christ's hands would never become heavy. There is Aaron, signifying the priesthood and Hur, from the tribe of Judah, signifying the kingship. They put a stone for Moses to sit on. This is how we correspond to His intercession. We cannot intercede by ourselves, in ourselves. This stone, this support, that Moses sat on, signifies out prayer needs a solid support. It is our realisation that we are weak, that we cannot pray in ourselves, by ourselves. If we want to engage in this kind of prayer we cannot assume we can do it. Genuine prayer always issues out of solid base where the praying person realises I am not worthy, not able to sustain this prayer. I need the Spirit to come in to sustain me. Rom. 8, the Spirit joining in to our weakness, to pray in us. The genuine prayer is uttered not because we are up to it. The genuine prayer is prayed out of weakness. We sense that our prayer is so fragile, so undependable. Lord I need you to come into my prayer. We don't know what to pray, the Spirit comes in to help us in our prayer. We groan before the Lord. The genuine has this solid base as a rock.

With Aaron, the priesthood, connected with our spirit. It's not something we can dream up. Released from our spirit. The spirit is something of the priesthood. We need the strengthening of the priesthood for our prayer. We need the kingship demanding we submit ourselves to God. We must not pray rebellious prayers, Lord do this, do that, for me. Hur is needed, along with Aaron, along with the stone. Another status of Hur is his descendant was a skilful craftsman for the building of the temple. With the assistance of Aaron and Hur we have the kingship and priesthood, we must pray in view of the temple, the building of the church. Toward God's building. Remember these four elements: the stone, the priesthood, the kingship and the building.

Joshua was in the battle. The fighting Spirit. Our Joshua, as Jesus, is the fighting Spirit engaging in the direct battle.

Gal. 5:24, *we* need to crucify the flesh. We need to put to death. When we see the old man being lived out. We need to crucify it. But we cannot by our own will. We need to power of the fighting Spirit. The one directly fighting against Amalek is not you and me but Joshua, the fighting Spirit.

Application. We need to be praying. Unceasing prayer. Whenever we are not praying we are in the flesh automatically. We need to shave every day. The next day the hair comes back again. You cannot rely on one time overcoming. We need to pray unceasingly. This kind of prayer needs to be continual. Also we need to exercise the spirit, live in the spirit, to allow this fighting Spirit to slay the flesh in us. First, see the fact that Christ already crucified the flesh on the cross. Stand with that fact. Second we need to acknowledge and agree with it. We need to agree, to stand with what Christ accomplished. Third, apply the fact by applying the Spirit.

## IV. God commanded Saul to "strike the Amalekites" and to "utterly destroy all that they have" and not spare them, but he did not obey Jehovah's command

Experientially we treasure the good aspects of our flesh, the natural life and do not wish to destroy them. It is easy to recognise the ugly parts of the flesh. We reject, condemn those. There are the good aspects of the flesh. Our love, our kindness, our humility, our zeal. They can all be in the realm of the flesh. We view them as something we can keep.

Agag and the best of the sheep and oxen. Under the cloak to offer them as sacrifice to God. So often we hear saints say they consecrate themselves to move here to do this for God, etc. It's honourable. But then we have to ask, in your consecrating yourself, who is doing it? You? Your good flesh? Or it is something the Lord is operating in you? This touches a very sobering matter. It is not so easily discernible. There are so many needs and we have certain ability, certain feeling to respond to it and we jump on it. Without any kind of consideration before the Lord. Is it me Lord? Or is it the spirit? Amalek and Israel are cousins. Many times we cannot distinguish. But the excuse of "I am sacrificing to Jehovah" does not answer the question. We need to check the source.

If we ever reach the point we can preach the gospel and never humble yourself and pray, Lord without You I am just a person in the Lord. I'm fearful of myself. I have been speaking a lot. I have known, to some degree how to speak. But every time before coming up to a platform I pray, Lord I need You. Without You I cannot say anything. Do not allow me to say anything that is not out of You. I have seen ones who after serving for a time becoming confident, they can do it so well. At the end they will make a monument for themselves. It is not that hard to recognise the ugly part of the flesh, but it is not that easy to see the good part of the flesh, to condemn it, judge it, repudiate it.

Can one read the Bible in the flesh? Can one pray in the flesh? Can one preach the gospel in the flesh? Yes. Paul himself said, some preach the gospel out of rivalry. Out of selfish ambition. They are announcing Christ, but it's out of selfish ambition. You cannot say, I can do all this for God. You use the end to justify the means.

Presumptuous. You presume. I sacrifice to God. God must accept this. Just like Cain. God was displeased with his sacrifice. He offered according to his religion view. At that time fallen man had to bring forth the blood. Cain sacrificed to God. That was abhorrible to God. That was his presumptuousness. When the Lord returns, some would say, didn't I do this for you? The Lord says, I never knew you. Whatever good work you think you did for me, I never knew you, never allowed you.

## V. Doing good according to our own will is actually an act of rebellion against God's throne and His economy

We all need to allow the Spirit to speak this word to us. Brother Lee once said in Christianity today, for Christian workers to start up a church is easier than starting up a restaurant. To start a church, rent a space, get some chairs and you can run a church. How much is this kind of thing going on? Creating division, confusion. In today's internet age its a free market. Anyone can get a website, get a camera. I can do my ministry. It's so easy to do something for God these days. So convenient, so easy. What is the source? Is it really the Spirit? Or just a lot of people appreciate it and respond to it? Maybe it's the flesh. Maybe it's your self. Helping you to build a monument. making you feel good about yourself. We need the Lord's light to shine on our flesh. We all need the spirit to shine into us. Lord show me. I don't want to be ignorant about this. Because this is to serious a matter.

Saul told Samuel, let me come to worship *your* God. Jehovah was not Saul's God, He was Samuel's God. He was doing something for someone else's God. Doing what he thought was necessary to be done.

He was constituted with rebellion. Constitution is something automatic. Even when you act nicely your constitution may be one of rebellion, which is as evil as the worship of idols.

Samuel said, does Jehovah delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices more than to obey the voice of Jehovah. ... Rebellion is like a sin of divination and insubordination is like idolatry and teraphim.

Saul thought Jehovah would be happy with this. Jehovah is not delighted in your burnt offerings and sacrifices. Jehovah is delighted in your listening to your voice. David committed a sin and wrote a psalm. What kind of person David was compared to Saul? A contrite heart, a broken spirit is what you're looking for. But Saul was presumptuous. Altogether constituted with rebellion. It's a kind of idol worship. Original Hebrew, idols of vanity.

Saul's rebellion caused him to be in contact with demons. A sin of divination, witchcraft, the contact with demons.

In 1988, brother Lee told us during a rebellion, he said all these are not logical. These were all our brothers. Now look at the hatred. This is not logical. This is demonic. This is not something of man. This was something by demons. Saints, we can look back at some of the cases. Someone who got themselves into a kind of dissention, they were in touch with demons. They were energised by demons. Some of the things they were able to do, able to write, they were energised by demons. The capacity they suddenly had. Saints, we need to be fearful. When we rebel against God's word we open the door to idols of vanity.

Presumption. An unwarranted, unbecoming or impertinent boldness. More than just assuming something. Involves a kind of boldness that is unwarranted, unbecoming. Saul was presumptuous. He was bold. He said, "I did what God charged me."

## VI. Saul lost his kingship because he did not utterly destroy Amalek

That was the end of his kingship. He continued to rule but as far as God was concerned it was done.

To rule with Christ is our destiny, yet our rebellion will cause us to lose the kingship.

When Amalek is dealt with the kingdom of God immediately comes in.

Brother Lee said we need to experience God's organic salvation from level to level until there is no more flesh but we are all in the spirit, beings of the NJ. This is the highest point. We are moving with the Lord, not just to gain knowledge and teaching. I hope the Lord can bring us higher, level by level, where we can reach that highest point where there is no more flesh. This is the NJ, the highest point. As long as the flesh is here the kingdom will be frustrated from coming in.

There is not place for the flesh in the kingdom of God. I hope the Lord will render us the light and grace to deal with the flesh in a serious way. We need to pray unceasingly way. We need to cooperating with the fighting Spirit.





# Qs

## 1. What are the three definitions of the flesh as used in the Bible? Cite the scriptural references.

- the fallen body

  Rom 6:6

  > Knowing this, that our old man has been crucified with Him in order that the body of sin might be annulled, that we should no longer serve sin  as slaves;

  Rom. 7:24

  > Wretched man that I am! Who will deliver me from the body of this death? 

- the totality of the fallen being

  Gen. 6:3

  > And Jehovah said, My Spirit will not strive with man forever, for he  indeed is flesh; so his days will be one hundred twenty years.

- the good aspects of man

  Phil. 3:3-6 

  > For we are the circumcision, the ones who serve by the Spirit of God and boast in Christ Jesus and have no confidence in the  flesh, 
  >
  > Though I myself have something to  be confident of in the flesh as well. If any other man thinks that he  has confidence in the flesh, I more: 
  >
  > Circumcised the eighth day; of the  race of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew born of Hebrews; as  to the law, a Pharisee; 
  >
  > As to zeal, persecuting the church; as to the righteousness which is in the law, become blameless. 



## 2. Explain why the flesh is the greatest destroyer of the Christian life.

- the flesh is out to destroy and frustrate God's purpose
- it is a perpetual war, it cannot be improved
- it makes us enemies with God
- it is the camp of God's enemy; when we are in the flesh we are one with Satan
- it is in rebellion against the throne



## 3. Show by the Scriptures how much Jehovah hates the flesh and the reasons for His hatred

   Exo. 17:14

   > And Jehovah said to Moses, Write this as a memorial in a book and recite *it* to Joshua, that I will utterly blot out the memory of Amalek from under heaven.

   Exodus 17:16

   > For he said, For there is a hand against the throne of Jah! Jehovah will have war with Amalek from generation to generation.

   Gal. 5:17

   > For the flesh lusts against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the  flesh; for these oppose each other that you would not do the things that you desire.

   Deut. 25:19

   > Therefore when Jehovah your God gives you rest from all your enemies surrounding *you,* in the land which Jehovah your God is giving you as an inheritance to  possess, you shall blot out the memory of Amalek from under heaven; you  shall not forget.

   Rom. 8:7

   > Because the mind set on the flesh is enmity against God; for it is not subject to the law of God, for neither can it be. 

   The flesh frustrates God's building and is the camp of Satan. In the flesh we are one with Satan. The flesh is in open rebellion against God. The flesh is also subtle, deceiving us into thinking we are carrying out God's will. God cannot do anything in us as long as we continue to give ground to the flesh.





## 4. Present the way to deal with the flesh according to the record in Exodus 17:8-13.

> Then Amalek came and fought with Israel in Rephidim.
>
> And Moses said to Joshua, Choose men for us, and go out; fight with Amalek. Tomorrow I will stand on the top of the hill with the staff of God in  my hand.
>
> So Joshua did as Moses had said to him and fought with Amalek; and Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill.
>
> And when Moses lifted his hand up, Israel prevailed; and when he let his hand down, Amalek prevailed.
>
> But Moses’ hands were heavy, so they took a stone and put *it* under him, and he sat on it; and Aaron and Hur supported his hands, one on one side and one on the other side. So his hands were steady until  the going down of the sun.
>
> And Joshua defeated Amalek and his people with the edge of the sword.

- the stone is our realisation that we are weak and cannot pray in our selves, we need to depend on the Lord
- Aaron is the priesthood and refers to the need for us to exercise our spirit
- Hur is the kingship and indicates we need to be submissive to the Lord's authority
- Hur's descendants worked on the building of the temple, showing we must pray in the direction of the building of God, the church
- Joshua is the fighting Spirit we need to be one with



## 5. Discuss the points related to Saul's failure as revealed in 1 Samuel 15 and its consequence.

- Saul did not destroy Agag and the "best" cattle and sheep. He used sacrifice to God as a cloak for his disobedience
- Saul was presumptuous concerned what God wants; bold and pretentious.
- Saul called Jehovah Samuel's God, showing he did not take God as his own
- Saul was constituted with rebellion and this brought him into contact with demons
- As a consequence, Saul lost the kingship.
