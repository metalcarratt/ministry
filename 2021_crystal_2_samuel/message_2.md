# Message Two - The Hannah Ministry

The Hannah Ministry - what is that? I hope we can really see this. Everything we share in this training is through the glasses of God's economy. Watchman Nee gave a message with this title.

1 Sam. 1 - There was this dear saint Alkanah who had two wives, one Peninih, the other was Hannah. Peninah had children but Hannah had no children. Penanah was her rival and provoked her bitterly because Jehovah had shut up her womb. Because she couldn't have children she was so distraut. She wept and wouldn't eat. Alkanah said, why are you weeping, why is your heart sad? Am I not better to you than ten sons? She was bitter in soul. Very important. This word bitter. She prayed to Jehovah and she wept much. She made a vow. If you look upon the affliction and remember me. She told the Lord she was His servant. But give to your female servant. Brother Lee had so many translations of the Bible. A male child. I just wanted to see what American Standard Version 1901 and Darby said, "Give to your female servant a man-child." This alternate translation, Samuel was a man-child. Alkanah and Hannah would go to the temple once a year. Hannah made vow, if you give me a man-child I will give him to Jehovah all the days of his life and no razor will come upon his head. That means he was a Nazarite. Numbers 6. Hannah was speaking in her heart. Only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard. She was praying desperately but with no sound. So Eli saw her and watched her mouth. So he said, with no discernment, Woman how long will you be drunk, put away your wine from you. She said to Eli, No my Lord, I am a woman oppressed in spirit, but I have been pouring out my soul before Jehovah. We all need to do this. This needs to be our daily habit. Out of the greatness of my anxiety and provocation I have been speaking all this time. If you have anxiety, speak to the Lord. You can tell the Lord anything and everything that is bothering you. We need to have conversations with the Lord where we are genuine with the Lord. That's when the Lord will deal with things in our being. In chapter 4 the Ark was captured he fell backwards and broke his neck. This was predicted by a man of God and by Samuel himself as a little boy. This was a good thing Eli said to Samuel, "Speak Jehovah for your servant is listening." He had an ear to hear what Jehovah was speaking. Eli asked Samuel, what did the Lord say to you. Samuel was reluctant but Eli forced him. Samuel told Eli what was going to happen to him and to his two sons. All Eli said was, Well, He is the Lord, let Him do what He wants. He should have fallen on his face and fasted and prayed. The Lord spoke this to Eli through Samuel because he wanted to leave a deep impression on Samuel about what was going on. Samuel observed the positive things in Eli, he also observed the negative things. Those negative things became a warning to him his whole life, and that warning preserved him. Eli said to Hannah, Go in peace and may the God of Israel give you your request. Hannah went away and she ate and her countenance was sad no more. She asked for her son and hadn't conceived, but she believed what Eli told her, so her countenance wasn't sad anymore. That came out of her honest conversation with the Lord. In due time Hannah conceived and bore a son. Hannah did not go up and said when the child is weaned I will bring him up, so he may appear before Jehovah and stay there forever. Alkanah said do what is good in your sight. Only may Jehovah establish His Word. These were two people on the line of life. Hannah brought the child to Eli, I am the woman who stood before you, it was for this child I prayed, I for my part, have lent him to Jehovah all the days he lives. At the end of this chapter. What does this indicate? At this time God was poor as far as the priesthood was concerned. Utterly degraded, stale. Lent means, you won't be poor anymore.

## We have to realise what the Lord's recovery is; the Lord's recovery is to build up Zion, which typifies the overcomers as the reality of the Body of Christ to consummate the holy city, the New Jerusalem

The basis of the rest of the outline. We need to have this vision and revelation. We need to know what Zion is. This is the reason the Lord brought us into His recovery. He wants to produce overcomers. He wants His Bride, constituted soley with overcomers.

The overcomers are the strengthening, the beauty of the local church.

Everytime the OT speaks of the relationship of Zion and Jerusalem it shows the life and blessing of Jerusalem come from Zion.

- 1 Kings 8:1 - 
- Psa. 51:18 -
- 102:21 - the name of the Lord was in Zion, His praise was in Jerusalem
- 128:5 The Lord blessed out of Zion and the good was seen in Jerusalem
- 135:21 The Lord dwelt at Jerusalem but the Lord was to blessed out of Zion
- Isa. 41:27 The Word was first announced to Zion then preached to Jerusalem
- Joel 3:17 - When God dwelt in Zion Jerusalem would be holy.

He who overcomes will inherit these things. To overcome is to overcome unbelief and to believe into the Lord Jesus, you receive the effectiveness of His redemption and the process of His organic salvation. But we are in the Lord's recovery to build up Zion. He has to gain His bride before He can gain His wife.

The NJ is a cube, 12,000 stadia long, high and wide. We can say that the NJ is the Holy of Holies for this reason. In both the tabernacle and the temple it was a cube, equal in length, breadth and height.

We need to be desperate to pray at any cost and pay any cost.

Eph. 6:17-18 - Rhema - His personal updated speaking, the washing of the water in the Word. 

Col. 4:2 - persevere in prayer, watching in it with thanksgiving. Everything is against our prayer.

Phil. 3:18 - I count all things to be lose on account of the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord ... that I may gain Christ. We want to gain Christ, win Christ. He's our prize. Paul was not contented. Practice this one thing. Forgetting. Forgetting the things which are behind. From 5m ago to when you were born. The Lord is the great I Am. He is the present tense. He is "today". We only have today, we don't have tomorrow. We are on our way up. Footnote on the word prize. The prize is the fullest enjoyment and gaining of Christ. I always pray, Lord Jesus, guide me into the reality today of having the fullest reality and gaining of Christ. He's waiting for people to pray such a prayer.

Lord, make me a person who's absolutely open to You, and absolutely possessed by You.

Beachhead - we want to be the beachhead through which the Lord will return to possess His kingdom. In WWII the Allies were going to make this invasion with boats into France. The Nazis had all these embattlements. At Normandy, these things they built, the bombs couldn't penetrate them. They have machine guns and cannons everywhere. In God's NT economy, brother Lee said this, Hitler was bombing England and all of a sudden he turned to attack Russia. A whole army got decimated. That was turning point in the whole war. Brother Lee said, the sevenfold intensified Spirit turned Hitler from England to Russia. The sevenfold intensified Spirit are before the throne of God to execute His policies on the earth. Don't think He is not involved. When need to see Him as the king of glory. The Nazis thought they were going to invade at the shortest point. But they went to Normandy, which was a distance. And they went in the worst weather. I was looking out on the English channel and I asked my son, can you imagine here as the Nazi defenders. All of a sudden 5000 ships appear in their sight. It was the largest bombardment in human history. The general who headed up this defence said we have to hurl them back into the English channel. He said if we don't do this we are going to lose this war. We gained that beachhead and go into France and eventually all the way to Berlin. The first time I went to Paris and met a seeking brother. Brother Lee said to that brother, I recommend to brother so and so to go the a conference on such and such a date. So we met him. He invited us to his home. Which was about an hour and a half outside of Paris. We went to his home and his congregation. These people were really open. On that trip we went to Normandy. When we were in downtown Paris, this older Frenchman said to Bob and I, you're American aren't you? I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart for your people coming here to rescue my country. The older French people appreciate this country but the younger people don't appreciate. I saw this monument near Normandy. It said, Fight for the first 200 yards. That's the beachhead. Psa 27:10, Lift up your ?? and Jehovah the King will come in. He is the King of armies. When the Lord comes back, He's on a white horse and those who follow him are on white horses. Those are the overcomers and those are His army. Our honeymoon will begin at the battle of armageddon. That will be the beginning of our honeymoon. This psalm unveils the victorious Christ. The gates are of the cities of the nations. The door are the houses of the people. Long enduring doors, waiting and expecting with long endurance. All the nations in a general way are expecting Christ will come. We need to lift up our heads and wait and expect His coming with long endurance. Rev 19:13-14.

No other way except by praying. 

## II. The first book of Samuel show us in typology the bringing in of Christ as the King (typified by David) with His kingdom

### A. priesthood had become stale and waning

We don't want to be stale Christians. We don't want to be in a situation of waning. The sins of the sons of Eli were so great. Eli said some things to them, but not forcefully enough. Listen to this verse: *But they would not listen to the voice of their father, for Jehovah was pleased to kill them.* That shows how evil they were. A man of God came to Eli and said to Eli, Why do you honour your sons more than me?

Lord, make me one of your Samuels.

Malacai, the Lord is the sun. That the overcomers shine forth like the sun mean we have been deified. 

We should be looking for something new. We want to enter into a new revival that has never been seen on the earth before.

### B. God worked behind the scenes - He shut up Hannah's womb and prepared Penninah to provoke her to the extent she wept

### C. Forced Hannah to pray for a male child  - her prayer was initiated by God

### D. Hannah was on the line of life and God could motivate her

Lord, if you have anything I can accomplish for your purpose, I am her. God needs many Hannahs, people that can bring forth Samuel to turn the age. We need Hannahs who will bring in the King. Hannah though her prayer brought forth Samuel. Samuel is an overcoming Nazarite. Lord, make me a person who is produced as an overcoming Nazarite and who prays to bring forth more Nazarites. That will bring back the King with His kingdom.

### E. God was the real origin of Samuel

Hannah's prayer was an echo, a cooperation with the divine move.

Our prayers should result in the bringing forth of the overcomers. What have we done in this respect? Are you praying prayers that will result in the bringing forth of overcomers, including you yourself? We all need to ask that question to ourselves.

I greatly appreciate M.E.Barber. She went back to China after being dismissed from the missionary group. There was one young brother she produced as an overcomer. In her will she willed her Bible to brother Nee. Brother Nee gave a lot of testimonies about her. He said when I went into her living room and she was in the kitchen I could sense the Lord's presence. Sister Barber was waiting for the Lord's coming, when she was walking with brother Nee she said, O, maybe when we turn the corner the Lord will come back. That was her expectation.

## III. The first book of Samuel stands for a ministry that brings in the King with His Kingdom; we may call this "the Hannah ministry"

Hannah's ministry was to bring in the King whereas Penninahs "ministry" was to have many children.  Matt. 13, a small mustard seed is supposed to bring forth a small plant. Instead it gets transmogrified into a great tree. That tree signifies degraded Christendom as a transforgrified mustard seed. And the birds settle in the branches. The birds signify Satan and demons and evil spirits. Yes, we do want the increase. But be careful, we don't want to become a great tree. We will always be a remnant. We should never think we're going to be a great tree.

We want to have the honour of cooperating with the Lord to bring Him back. We all believe these are the last days. God's eyes are on those who can be the means of bringing in the King. We need to ask ourselves, do we have any part in this more important ministry?

The way we are taking is not an easy way. I asked the Lord, I don't understand. Why is my dad upset with me? He said to me one time, all you do is read your Bible, and you're telling me to be a Christian at my age? I tried to be very respectful to my dad. I loved him more after I got saved. It wasn't an easy way.

Not a matter of getting many saved but a company of overcomers.

Envy is a horrible thing in the spiritual realm. I've seen this. It's terrible. I've seen this in the work. A co-worker being used the Lord, this other one full of envy.

Brother Nee ends his message with something like, the child in 1 Samuel 1 is the man-child in Revelation 12. 

Rev. 12:10, travailing pain to bring forth. Throughout all generations God's people have been suffering the delivery of this man-child. This man-child was brought up to God and to His throne.

## IV. Hannah's experience shows that we need to pour out our soul before the Lord in the midst of our bitterness; In Exodus 15 the children of Israel came to the bitter waters of Marah; when the people murmured against Moses, he "cried out to Jehovah, and Jehovah showed him a tree; and he cast it into the waters, and the waters became sweet."

Moses cried out to Jehovah. And Jehovah showed him a tree. What a revelation! And he cast it into the waters and the waters became sweet.

The tree God showed Moses signifies the tree of life. 1 Pet. 2:24, bore up our sins in His body on the tree. Same Greek word for tree of life. The tree there signifies the cross. Brother Lee says, the children of Israel took three days to arrive at these bitter waters. These three days signify resurrection. That tree signifies the resurrected Christ. In another portion he says the tree signifies the cross, the crucified Christ. Which one do you pick? Rev. 2:7, the tree of life in Rev. 2:17 signifies the crucified (wood) and resurrected (life). The tree Moses cast into the waters was the crucified and resurrected Christ.

Our prayer, our pouring out our heart before the Lord, is our casting this tree into the waters of our bitter situation.

Psa 62:8 is a command, "pour out your heart before Him." - words spoken genuinely from the heart.

brother Lee, (lessons for new believers, pg 325)

> The first thing about prayer is to speak genuinely from the heart. We must pray according to our inward feeling. Do not be pretentious. We should speak what we feel within. When we are angry we should voice our anger within. When we are happy we should voice our happiness before God. When we are sad... under pressure... sinful... we should speak what we feel within, speaking genuine words from our heart. This can be likened to a young child ... the words of a child are always genuine.

Psa 102 title - A prayer of an afflicted one when he is fainting and pours out his complain before Jehovah. We may complain before God but our complaining may be the best prayer. He is causing all things to work together for good.

brother Nee, (collected works, Tell Him)

> We may experience the sorrow of losing our parent, children, spouse, relatives that results in our being sorrow, disappointed and we don't see any way out ... these are the times we should draw near to the Lord. We can tell the Lord our sorrows, He's the best listener. He knows our emotion, He sympathises with our heart. When we have such a time our intimacy with the Lord is one step further. These contacts are a hundred times better than our normal contacts. We should bring our problems before the Lord. He can comfort us. If a person has never ... he has never had any deep fellowship with the Lord. One can only be brought closer to the Lord through telling Him everything.

Hymn, Oh Lord, breathe Thy Spirit on me, Pour onto His bosom all my life of self and sin.

When Hannah prayed in this way, she prayed for a Nazarite, an overcoming Nazarite. Any time we come to bitter waters. That is the time to draw near to the Lord, cry out to Him and pray to Him in a real, sincere way. We will know the Lord more. The Lord will flow out of us to produce other overcomers.

Qs

1. What is the Lord's recovery today?
2. What point of great importance does the first book of Samuel show us in typology?
3. What is the "Hannah ministry"?
4. What is the intrinsic significance of Hannah pouring our her soul before the Lord in the midst of her bitterness in relation to the healing of the bitter waters in Exodus 15, and how does this apply to our personal experience?
