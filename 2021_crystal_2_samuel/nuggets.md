## Message 1

### Kingdom of God

Gods purpose is to have a kingdom in the land. Everything is for this. The land, the building, the temple. The labouring on the land and the produce of the land. The kingdom is a realm, a sphere in which He is expressed in order to have His intention. God wants an expression, but this expression needs a proper realm in which He can be expressed. In the coming age that kingdom will be the whole earth. Eventually God will require a new heaven and new earth as the realm for His expression.

Hannah and Samuel were both for the kingdom. Their prayer and their cooperation with God was so that He could bring in the kingdom. They fulfilled an urgent need of the Lord's. Wouldn't it be a blessing if the Lord could say your life was useful in bringing in His kingdom? It would give meaning to your whole life.

Saul wanted a monarchy for himself. David was led through years of preparation to be the king - opposition, suffering, dealings.

### Cooperation 

The principle of incarnation - God enters into man and mingles with man to make man one with Himself; thus God is in man and man is in God, having one life and living. Samuel was such a person.

Deeply impressed - the fulfillment of God's economy requires out cooperation. Not *their* cooperation. *Our* cooperation.

To cooperate with God means to be bound together with God. God chooses to be bound together with us. We say, "Amen, we would be bound together with You." It's inseparable. God will bring us gradually to the point this will become our normal living.

### Hannah's prayer

Hannah was forced to pray a desperate prayer, motivated by God secretly. She prayed for a man-child who would be absolute for God on earth. There was another wife with children who mocked her. She wanted to be a mother but the Lord would not listen to an ordinary prayer. The Lord realised if He waited long enough she would be inwardly uplifted and her prayer would change to one that could turn the age. Her prayer matched God's move and intention. "If you give me a son I will consecrate him to be a Nazarite."

### Divine Trinity as the structure

The Divine Trinity was involved in bringing forth Samuel.

1. The offerings which are a type of Christ as our reality, which Hannah brought year by year to offer to God, and enabled her to come forward to God in prayer.
2. The tabernacle which is a type of Christ as the embodiment of God, as the place Hannah could come to pray to God and pour our her heart.
3. The Spirit moving in Hannah to make a desperate prayer.

It's not possible for us to pray as Hannah did by ourselves. We need to strengthening of the Divine Trinity. We need Him. He will transmit His burden, feeling into us.


## Message 2
### the hannah ministry vs the peniniah ministry
hannah ministry - to bring in the king

peniniah ministry - to have many children

this is the way of the LR vs the way of christianity with the great tree

hannah's way is not an easy way. Rev 12:10, suffering to bring forth the man child

### pouring out soul
she was afflicted and bitter in soul. she was pouring out her soul before Jehovah. out of the greatness of her anxiety and provocation. we all need to do this daily. tell the lord everything that is bothering us. conversations where we are genuine with the Lord. that's when the lord will deal with things in our being.

Exo 15, marah - God showed him a tree and he cast it in the waters and the waters became sweet. The tree is the tree of life and the cross. pouring out our heart is our casting this tree into our bitter situation
Psa 62:8 pour out your heart before him

speak genuinely, not preteniously - whether angry happy or sad. sometimes our complaining is our best prayer

hannah received Eli's word "go in peace and may god hear your request" and her countenance was sad no more. she believed what eli had said. the result of her honest conversation with the Lord. in due time she conceived and bore a son.

### zion, the overcomers
the strengthening and beauty of the church

the overcomers are the beachhead through which the lord will return to possess his kingdom. normandy a picture of this. "fight for the first 200 yards"

### prayer for the nazarites
pray to bring forth more nazarites. pray for the bringing in of the king with the kingdom through these nazarites

Hannah's prayer an echo, a cooperation with the divine move

our prayers should bring in the overcomers. how much have we done this? both for ourselves and for others

Sister Barber produced one overcomer. she lived for the Lord's second coming. (Because of her, we are all here today.)


## Message 3
### The side door (the Nazarite vow) is opened
Samuel was not of the line of priests - he was a descendent of Korah the rebel. But in God's provision there was a "side door", a "back-up plan" in case the priesthood failed. That side door was the Nazarite vow. It qualified someone to become a priest. The priesthood did fail, and Samuel gained the right to become a priest. The same is true today. Christianity has failed. God has opened the way for us, the to be overcomers by being Nazarites.

### Learning to listen
Samuel learned from Eli how to listen to God. When we go before the Lord the more important thing is to listen than to speak. The slave had his ear bored through. His position is to listen to the master's words. All our service should come out from the Lord's direct speaking to us. Anything else is presumptous. In those days the Word of God was rare. But not to Samuel, because he had an opened ear.

### Learning from the negative examples
Samuel saw many negative examples. Instead of being affected by them he observed and learned what not to do. He also saw God's punishment on those who practiced in that way. Such an observation was a preservation to him.

Samuel learned to be under God's arrangement and wait on Him. He did not try to escape from the negative environment or change it. He was not in rebellion or revolution but partaking of revelation.

### Samuel was the acting God on earth
As a Nazarite - absolute for God. He had not future ambitions or aspirations. He existed only to carry out what was in God's heart.

As a Priest - He spoke the Word of God, which was the role of the priest. What God's people needed was God's speaking. God's word was rare at those times. But not to Samuel.

As a Prophet - supplementing the kingship, as a supervision, support, help and observation. 
As a Judge - Samuel was not the king but he provided the by-laws and constitution of the kingdom.

As a man of prayer - He said far be it from me to sin against Jehovah by ceasing to pray for you. He had a heart for God's people and considered not praying a sin.
