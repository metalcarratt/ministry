# Message Six - Spiritual Principles, Life Lessons and Holy Warnings seen in the History of David

There is a particular message in the LS about David called "prepared by God to be a man according to the heart of God". Chosen, trained, anointed, tested and approved. I encourage you to look at that LS. Acts 13:22, I have found David the son of Jessie, a man according to my heart, who will do all my will.

Why is he a man according to God's heart. David said to Solomon, It was on my heart to build a house for Jehovah my God. This matches Matt. 16:18, I will build my church. This is the greatest prophecy in the Bible. It has not come into full fruition yet.

David was chosen by God. Samuel was sent by God to the house of Jessie. I love what the Lord said to Samuel. Do not regard his appearance and the height of his stature for I have rejected him. For it is not how man sees that matters. For man looks on the outward appearance but Jehovah looks on the heart.

Trained. He was trained by God. He was the last son and the eighth son. Eight is the number for resurrection. As the youngest one, this was to make him humble. He was assigned to go to the field to take care of the sheep. A humble occupation. Jessie had all his seven sons pass in front of Samuel. And Samuel said, do you have another son? Jessie's feeling toward David was he was insignificant. That contributed to his humility.

Samuel anointed David. David was approximately 15 years old when Samuel anointed him.

He was tested and approved by God. When we say tested by God, there is one great incident in his trusted God and defeating Goliath. Goliath was approximately 9 feet 9 inches tall. Here's this young boy. When he defeated Goliath that spread through all of Israel. Not only did he defeat Goliath, he suffered the ill treatment of Saul so that he might be broken.

From *The Vision of God's Building*. 

> Many young brothers need a Saul who will continually deal with them, ill treat them and supress them.

If you're experiencing this you need to say, Praise the Lord.

## I. In the history of David we need to see God's sovereignty and David's learning the lessons of the cross

### A. Defeating Goliath

Saul asked David, who's son are you? David said, the son of your servant Jessie, the Bethlehemite. A Moabitess was involved in bringing forth David.

Can you imagine? The lion or bear had the lamb in it's mouth. He would go out after it. That's how we should be in our shepherding. Go out after the saints who have departed from the flock. David was full of confidence, which was divine confidence.

He took Goliath's sword and beheaded him. David told him he was going to do that. David was prepared by God.

**All things under God's sovereignty**

Sometimes we realised "this" is the enemy attacking. But we also have realise that even the enemy's attack is under God's sovereignty.

Matt. 10:29-31. Two sparrows. Not one of them will fall to the earth apart from your Father. When a sparrow falls to the earth the Father is aware of that. Do not fear. You are of more value than many sparrows.

Psa. 39:9, I was dumb. I did not open my mouth. For You have done this.

When Absalom rebelled against David this person began to throw stones and dust and David. One of David's mighty men said, let me go over there and do away with him. David said don't do it. He had the sense God had permitted it. I like David's realisation there.

Rom. 8:28-29, All things work together for God so that we might be conformed to the image of His Son. All matters, situations, environments are for our good, our conformation to the firstborn Son of God.

The subject of Esther is the hiding God to take care of God's people secretly to save them openly.

### B. Selected as an attendant of Saul

This was God's sovereignty. By these two put together, Saul was exposed as a person opposite to God's will and David was manifested as a man according to God's heart.

All the women and children came out from all the towns to sing and dance. Saul has struck down his thousands but David his ten thousands. When Saul heard that he was very angry. It greatly displeased him. He said, what more can he have except the kingdom? From that day Saul kept his eye on David. One day Saul was sitting on the throne, the spear was in his hand and he tried to strike that spear into David.

**praise**

Prov 27:21 A man is tried by the praise given him.

When we're serving the Lord we need to be more fearful of the praise given us, more than the criticism.

**envy**

Gal 5:25 If we live by the Spirit let us also walk by the Spirit. 26 Let us not become vainglorious, provoking one another, envying one another.

Verse 26 is a test of verse 25. We shouldn't envy anyone's function.

**no avenging**

Avenging and fighting back are matters of the flesh.

Rom. 12:19 Do not avenge yourselves beloved, but give your place to the wrath of God, for it is written, vengeance is mine, I will repay.

David had the opportunity to kill Paul. The second time everyone was sound asleep. David's attendant said, let us just kill him here. David said we are not going to touch him, he is God's anointed one. David said take the spear and the water jug. David shouted out to Abner and said, "Why aren't you protecting your king?" Saul realised and expressed sorrow that he was trying to kill David. But he reverted back to the way he was.

Authority and Submission. A whole chapter of David's knowledge of God's authority, which is really good.

I hope we are all really exercised in our spirit. This outline is itself a message. I pray that as we read through it, it will become the Lord's speaking to all of us.

**breaking of the cross**

Lord, by Your mercy, cause me to pay the price to experience the breaking of the cross. Teach me to know and deal with my natural disposition.

To bear the cross. Two aspects: the inward application. Exo. 30:22-25, the holy anointing oil, the compound ointment, two of the elements are myrrh and cinnamon. Christ's death is in the Spirit and the Spirit is in our spirit. Cinnamon was used in ancient times as a heart stimulant. Sweetness and effectiveness of His death and He stirs up our heart to make us rejoicing in the Lord. The inward application of the cross cooperates with the outward environment to kill our natural man for the manifestation of Christ.

S.S. 2, the voice of my beloved! Now He comes, leaping on the mountains, skipping on the hills. My beloved is like gazelle or young heart.

Christ is the mountain leaping and hill skipping Christ. He leaps over ever barrier.

My dove. She had doves eyes, the insight of the Spirit. By this time she is a full dove. So saturated with the Spirit. In the clefts of the rock, in the covert of the precipice let me hear your voice. When we are in the clefts of the rock, dwelling in the crucified Christ, in the covert of the precipice, to get to the cleft of the rock, it's a rugged road, high up. We have Christ as a leaping gazelle. He transports us into the cleft of the rock and covert of the precipice. When we're in him our countenance is lovely.

ASV 1901 has all the pronunciation marks for the OT and NT. When I first started editing the ministry. Brother Lee said, make sure you have that book, it tells you how to pronounce every name.

Phil 3:10, I pursue toward the goal. Footnote. The goal is the fullest enjoyment and gaining of Christ. Today I want to have the fullest gaining of You, the fullest enjoyment of You.

2 Cor. 4:16-18, we do not lose heart, our outer man is decaying yet our inner man is being renewed day by day. Our outer man is composed of the soul with our person. When we get regenerated our person changes. Our person is now our spirit.

**if you are defeated by the Lord you are a winner**

2 Cor. 2:12-14, a door opened but I had not rest in my spirit. That's a big verse. Paul was not governed by the outward circumstances but by the rest in his spirit. Thanks be to God who always leads us in triumph in the Christ. This verse is a picture is a Roman general leading a defeated army into Rome in a triumphal procession. Factually speaking we got defeated by Christ. Actually and experientially we want to be in that triumphal procession every day. Brother Lee encouraged us to pray, Lord conquer me, make me your captive, never let me win, defeat me every time. If you allow him to defeat you, you are a winner.

**broken**

When a person is broken he has no trust in himself. Peter was so confident in his natural love for the Lord. If all these other disciples deny you I will never deny you. The Lord said before the rooster crows you will deny me three times. He wept bitterly. But thank the Lord that the Lord took him through that. That broke his naturalness in his love for the Lord. I love Thee Lord, but all the love is mine.

Paul - We were excessively burdened beyond our power, we despaired even of living. We had the response of death in ourselves that we should not base our confidence on ourselves but on God who raises the dead.

To really trust in God you have to brought into situations that are beyond your power. The Lord is training us in those situations to base our confidence on the resurrection power.

Mary had an alabaster flask and broke it and anointed the Lord's feet and the house was filled with the fragrance. We want a church life full of the fragrance of brothers and sisters loving the Lord. But that ointment could not be released without the breaking of that flask.

## II. David cared for God's habitation on earth, the habitation of the Ark of God

### A. David prepared for the building of the temple

David knew God did not want him to build the temple. So he did what he could. First he prepared the builder. Solomon was the son. He is the builder. Solomon means peace. God gave him another name, Jedidiah.

David prepared the site of the temple, the materials of the temple. God revealed to David by his spirit the pattern of the temple and before David died he gave this pattern to Solomon his son.

1 Chron 29:3, I set my affection on the house of God. He had a private treasure of gold and silver. He gave the whole thing for the house of God. He said to the children of Israel, who will offer willingly, consecrating himself. With their whole heart they offered willingly. And David the king was full of joy.

1 Chron 28:19, All of this has He made clear by the writing of Jehovah upon me, all the details of the pattern.

### B. God rejected David's good intention to build the temple

All our work and service in the church must be initiated by God and according to His desire.

The iniquity of the sanctuary. Everything we do should come out from God according to God's perfect will, through God as the means, ability, power, and everything we do should be to God for God's glory, not ours.

Rom. 11:36, out from him and through him and to him be the glory forever and ever, amen.

God said to David, "Is it you?" He was saying, it's not you. This is not your function, not your portion. We often do not have the realisation God needs to be the initiator. 

### C. David did not react because he feared God

The act of David stopping his desire to build the temple is a great matter.

We should serve Him according to His desire, His preference, His will. We sit at His feet to know His will.

### D. twofold testimony - all work should come from God, all that matters is what God does for man not what man does for God

David had the intention to build God a house. God said, David I'm going to build you a house. David was so humbled by that.

2 Sam 7:18, He went and sat before Jehovah and said, who am I, and what is my house that you have brought me this far.

v 25, Now O Jehovah God, confirm forever the word you have spoken forever. Do as You have spoken.

That is pray reading. When we pray His word back to Him He is bound to do as He has spoken.

### E. God wants only our cooperation

Matt 17:5, on the mount of transfiguration. The cloud of glory appeared. Peter was so fearful. What he spoke wasn't as usual the right thing. The voice said, This is My Son the Beloved in whom I have found my delight. Hear Him.

We came to this meeting to hear Him. Christ is the real Elijah, the real Moses, the reality of the law.

David had two great failures. His first we will talk about in this outline. Through that great failure, a terrible failure. The issue of that failure was Solomon. The issue of man's transgression and God's forgiveness.

**David's second failure**

David's second failure is at the end of 2 Samuel in 24. He numbered the people. I always wondered why this was a sin. If you read the ministry, for David to number the people was an act of unbelief and pride, putting his faith in Numbers. Satan stood up against Israel and moved David to number the people. Gideon had thousands of warriors. The people are too many. I don't want Israel to have any way to vaunt himself against Me. No ground to say my own hand has saved me. Gideon's force was reduced to 300. The Midianites were numerous. When God fights the battle He will win it.

In the truth lessons and the LS of Daniel, when Alexander the Great died he has four generals. One person, Antiocus Epiphanes. The things he did were just terrible. He had an idol in the temple. He slaughtered a pig and put it all over the altar and the sanctuary. There was a Judas Maccabeus. On Dec 25th he purified he sanctuary from all the idolatry. The fighers with him were great minority compared to Antiocus' army. This was a saying Judas had, It is not on the size of the army that victory depends, but strength comes from heaven.

So many men in the army. Look at my kingdom.

Nebuchadnezzar did the same thing. Daniel warned him about it. He told him what would happen if he didn't repent. Twelve months took place. One day on the roof and looking out. Is this not Babylon the Great I have built up by my power and my majesty. What Daniel said went into effect. You don't rule, the heavens rule. God sets up men over certain kingdoms according to his will. It was God's will that made you the king of Babylon. When Nebuchadnezzar came out he really had a praise to God.

## III. The account of God's punishing judgement on David is written as a warning to us today; God is not only loving and merciful, but also just and fearsome; God forgave David, but also disciplined and chastised David according to His governmental righteousness

2 Sam. 11, at the turn of the year, at the time when kings go forth to battle, David sent Joab out to battle but David didn't go out with them. David's business as king was to go out to battle. He remained at home. Because he was at ease and contentment he was in great peril.

He robbed Uriah the Hittite of his wife. Uriah was a faithful soldier. He wouldn't sleep in his bed when all of his soldiers were out fighting.

We should thank the Lord for this warning. We need to allow this warning to enter into our being. It will dispense God into us as a holy warning.

When you're reading the Bible on this portion, you have the feeling that it is so regrettable when you read this portion.

### G. the effect of David's great sin up to the present time

David's great sin was the inception of greater sin. Solomon had many wives and because of those wives he was seduced into worshipping idols.

Deut 17, "when you have a king he should make out a copy of the law for himself, and he should read it all the days of his life, so that his heart wouldn't be lifted up among his brothers." Think if I gave you an assignment to write out Matthew, Mark, Luke and John. I can guarantee you would get some of the Lord's speaking just by doing that. "He shall not amass wives to himself." David did that. Most of the kings did that. Solomon did that. David was a pattern to that. Solomon looked at his dad.

Solomon's corruption, the dividing of the kingdom, the loss of the nation of Israel, the captivity, the scattering across the whole globe. Now the nation of Israel has no peace up to the present time. All their young people have to be in the army. All the new soldiers had to go through the hall of memorial of the holocaust. One of the mottos of Israel is, "Never again."

### H

David restored his fellowship, but governmental hand was on David his whole life, even after his death.

### L

Lev. 18:25 because the land became defiled the land vomited out its inhabitants.

### M

I could not help thinking about Moses' end. His eyes was not dim and his freshness had not left him. Through the glasses of God's NT economy. The eyes are the eyes of our heart. Time of refreshing. That's where our freshness comes from. When I read this verse I just pray, Lord, I want my eye to be single to you all the days you measure out to me. And I want the freshness of your presence when I finish my course on this earth. Brother Lee's freshness never left him. He was always seeing something new.

Jacob was a supplanter and heel holder. If you look at the end of Jacob's life. He even blessed Pharaoh and the greater blesses the lesser. 

Joseph brough Epharim to Jacob and Manesseh. Israel streched out his hands and put his right hand on the younger son and his left hand on the older son. Joseph tried to correct his father. Jacob said, Don't worry Joseph, I know what I'm doing. Jacob blessed Joseph. The God who has shepherded me all my life to this day. Jacob had a bright ending. He ended up as a blesser. In God's eyes he was the top person in the world.

Prov. 2:18, the paths of the righteous is like the light of dawn which shines brighter and brighter until the full day.

### N

Practical application of God's government and God's governmental forgiveness.

It is very sorrowful to me, Paul says to admonish the disorderly, busy bodies, little souled. Not much capacity to take in certain things. Sustain the weak in spirit, soul, body or faith. I've seen this happen. Saints who are weak and others be very critical of them. That's not the time to be critical of them, that's the time to support them.

Avoid criticising, condemning or speaking about other lightly.

One brother said to me, the reason why this brother is that way is because the brother he was under was that way. It makes a big difference how you're raised in the church life, and who you associate with. We were concerned about one brother, what we should do. Benson said, brothers how can we help this brother? I was with brother Lee one time, brother Lee was considering about certain brothers to go to Russia. One person applied. Each one of the co-workers said this and that. He said, isn't he a lovely brother. He is very useful in Russia, even up to this day.

We have been called to bless others, so we, as a blessed people, should always bless others that we may inherit blessing; what we bless others with, we will inherit ourselves.



# Qs

## 1. What is the intrinsic significance of David's seeing God's sovereignty and his learning the lessons of the cross, and how does it apply to our personal experience?

Under God's sovereignty David was tested in the battle with Goliath and trained by being put with Saul. This testing and training:

- He learned humility, being born the last of eight sons; even his father held him in low esteem
- He had confidence in God from his time guarding the sheep
- He learned not to be affected by praise
- He learned authority by submitting to God's deputy authority even though he was trying to kill him
- He was broken, learning the lessons of the cross

## 2. How did David care for God's habitation on earth, the habitation of the Ark of God, and how does this apply to us?

- He prepared the builder, the site, the materials, and received the pattern revealed in his spirit, which he gave to Solomon
- He did not react when God stopped him from actually building the temple - he did not rebel against God
- We should have a heart for God's building, but we must allow God to initiate everything.

## 3. What is the holy warning to us today concerning the account of David's great sin, of his falling under God's governmental hand, and of the Christian life being a life of learning God's government?
