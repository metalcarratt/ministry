# Message Nine - The organic building up of the church as the Body of Christ through the process of spiritual metabolism according to the believers' inner experience of the indwelling Christ

The application of the revelation in 2 Samuel 7:12-14. While this portion reveals the wonderful person of the seed of David becoming the Son of God. The emphasis, the background, the goal of that portion of the Word is concerning God's building. That portion of the word started of by David having a desire to build a house for God. God in response to that desire of David, came through Nathan the prophet to speak to David. David could not build a house for God. God had to first built a house for David. Then out of that house God builds for David a seed will come forth. That seed will build the house for God. God says I will be His Father and He will be My Son. This involves a very profound a rich revelation concerning the person of Christ and how He was a seed of Man in His humanity but He became the Son of God. Such a person is qualified to build God's house. We want to see how to apply this revelation.

This matter of the building of the church has been neglected, misunderstood by Christians in the last 2000 years. They were either ignorant or misunderstood what it means to build the church. If you talk to pastors or leaders in denominations, religious workers, their view of building the church is a way of organisation, a way of arrangement, their doing something to carry our some activities to bring about a kind of organisation. If we want to see the genuine meaning of building the church we have to come to this portion of 2 Samuel 7.

In 1940 when br Lee went to visit br Nee in Shanghai in a casual way and they were talking to each other. Br Nee told br Lee, in my hand is the blueprint of the building up of the church. That was a very striking statement he made. In their further conversation he expounded on that. It consists of three points. One of the points was: The material of this building must be uniquely Christ, who is everything. That one statement made a deep impression to br Lee. That statement was simple but actually profound and all-inclusive. It took br Lee the next fifty years to fully develop and expound that.

Br Lee showed us the all-inclusive Christ and eventually we're shown that the highest point is that this God came to be a man so that man may become God in life and in nature but not in the Godhead. This revelation was first realised in the Person of Christ. The high peak of the divine revelation. This high peak is not just for some kind of knowledge to speak to each other. This revelation has an issue, has a result. The issue is the divine building. The issue is the building of God into man and the building of man into God. The genuine proper building of the church is not by any kind of human arrangement or activity. Not something physical or outward. Altogether related to this Christ who is divine and human. The process of bringing divinity into humanity and humanity into divinity involves a kind of constitution. He constituted humanity that he put on for 33 and a half years. In His death He did not take off that humanity. He brought it into divinity. And thus He became the firstborn Son of God, implying that after Him there would be many brothers who are like Him, human and divine.

I hope after seeing this we can also say we have the blueprint of the building of the church in our hand. I have not surveyed every situation and person, but in a general way among so many Christian workers and church leaders, who knows what is the genuine building up of the church. This portion has been hidden, concealed from so many of God's children.

We do not neglect or belittle the necessary arrangements and activities such as preaching the gospel to make them building materials, shepherding and perfecting the new ones. But as we are carrying out these activities, there is a governing vision controlling us. Just those activities alone will not result in the building up of the church. It is the Christ we are ministering and infusing into His children, the Christ who is human and divine, will effect the building up of the Body of Christ.

## I. Second Samuel 7:12-14a is the unveiling of a prophecy through typology showing us that we need God to build Christ into our intrinsic constitution so that our entire being will be reconstituted with Christ

### A. Mutual abode

This portions was not only a prophecy but also a typology. The seed of David is literally Solomon, but Solomon is a type of Christ. Through the years Christian workers used this verse (Matt. 16:18) to so-called build the church. They have no idea how to build. These workers want to build a church. According to this instruction, this commandment. Actually, they are the ones who are trying to build a church. But according to that word Jesus gave, none of us, no human beings are qualified, able, allowed to build the church. Only Christ is able to build the church. Even as the workers go out to preach the gospel, to gain new ones, to gain materials for God's building. It is not just the people becoming the building material. It is the Christ ministered into them. Only Christ is acceptable for the building up of the church.

This building involves Christ being built into the intrinsic constitution of us. So that our entire being will be reconstituted with Christ.

God's economy, His plan, is a household administration. God desires to gain a household by dispensing Himself with all that He is into His chosen people to be everything to them to make them one with Him. Not just God imparting something into them. **Building. Construction.** *Bringing together different elements to construct something.* Not merely moving to impart Himself into us. God is doing a building work in man. God who is divine, man who is human. God is doing a building work in man by imparting His divine element into them. To bring these two elements to construct them together.

That Christ may make His home in our heart. He wants to make His home. He wants to settle down. This phrase, "Making his home" implies He is doing a building work. He is building a habitation for Himself in us. That habitation will also be our habitation. In the NT we see again and again.

John 15, abide in me and I in you. How we can life in and with the divine trinity. The NT is full of this expression.

Christ is building a home, a habitation in the human heart. This is a mutual dwelling place. The NJ is the ultimate consummation of that building work. NJ is the tabernacle and the temple. As the tabernacle for God to dwell in and as the temple for man to dwell in.

### B. To build Himself into us

Christ does not want to merely redeem us, rescue us from God's judgement. He wants to come into us and build Himself with us. To be in something in not the same as to build up something. We are in this building, but I am not part of this building. These columns are part of this building. They are built into this building. They are an integral part of this building. To build you and me into Himself. He becomes an integral part of us and we become and integral part of Him.

Until Christ is formed in you. Just like a babe. Conceived in a mother's womb. As that child grows that little babe is being formed, the head, the limbs, so forth. The little life begins to take shape. Christ does not merely want to do something for us. He wants to come into us. He want to be formed in us. For a babe to be formed it takes nine months. From a tiny seed to become a little person. Little by little Christ wants to be formed in us.

He is not so simple. Our Saviour, our master. He is everything. He has done everything and attained everything for this purpose. To enter into us and constitute Himself into us.

## II. Ephesians 3:16-21 reveals that the Triune God has come into us to do a building work with Himself as the element and also with something from us as the material; this is illustrated by the parable of the sower in Matthew 13

Eph. 3:16-21 is not merely to help us to be spiritual, to grow in life, to enjoy the Lord, to experience the Lord. The burden with this portion of the word is related to God's building work. In the whole Bible if we want to see His central work, it's found and revealed here in Eph. 3. We need to pray over these verses again and again. We should not just be content with a shallow familiarity. We spoke on these verses many many times. Many can recite them. It still may not have the deep impact in us as it should. After seeing the significance of 2 Sam 7 we need to apply that along with Eph. 3:16-21. Here we see the Triune God operating to come into us the believers to do a building work. With Himself as the element, and also with something from us as the material. Two things. One is divine, one is human. Best illustrated by the parable of the sower in Matt. 13. He sowed the seed, which is on the one hand the Word of God and on the other Himself to be sown into the human heart as the soil.

### B. Seed plus soil

When you see a certain plant growing out of the ground, you may think the plant is just a growing up of the seed. The seed is grown up out of the soil. The soil has a particular element and nutrients in it. It causes the shell to break down and the germ to break out. As the seed sprouts it's not just with the element of the see itself only. It brings only with it the nutrients absorbed into that seed. The plant that comes forth is the product of the seed with the nutrients in the soil. If you put a mustard see in the sand, nothing will happen, because there is no life, no nutrients in the sand. But when you put the seed in the soil with nutrients, something begins to happen. The result of that growth is something of the seed plus the soil.

### C. Nutrients and compatibility

When God came to create man He used the dust of the ground to form man's body and then he breathed into the nostrils of this man of clay, dust, with His breath of life. Jehovah's breath of life is breathed into the nostrils of this man of clay. This became the spirit in man. We see this in Jeremiah. Spirit is the same word as breath. So within every human being is something of God that has been breathed into him. Not exactly the life of God, but something from God, being imparted into man to form man's spirit. Now within man is something compatible with God. Man's heart, being, because it is out form Jehovah, His breath, there is something within us not only nutritious but also compatible with God. To grow certain plants or trees you need to have certain soil that is compatible with that plant or tree or else it will not grow. God as the seed is not planted in the human heart. In the human heart with the human spirit is the nutrients and something compatible with God that will cause that seed to sprout forth and grow. There are certain nutrients in our humanity that are compatible with the life of God.

Pas. 78:8 that they may not be like their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious generation who did not set their heart right. Our human spirit and human heart, the vital part of our inner being. They provide the nutrients necessary for the divine seed to grow. If that seed does not grow well we should not blame it on the seed. You have to look at the soil. The soil refers to our human heart and also our human spirit. Are we affording that seed the necessary nutrients. In this psalm the generation did not set their heart right. God could not get through. There was some problem, some blockage in their spirit and in their heart. Blessed are the poor in spirit. Blessed are the pure in heart. The Lord touches these two matters: our spirit and our heart. These are the parts of our inner being that supply the necessary nutrients to allow the seed to grow. If our spirit is not poor, not empty, if it is occupied all the time, and our heart is not pure, always distracted by many things, the seed will not grow well. We will be unable to render the necessary nutrients.

These days more than ever before, in the midst of this crooked and perverted generation we need to exercise our spirit much more than before. Everything around us is trying to stifle us, trying to annihilate, to annul, our life before God. We need to exercise our spirit. As Paul prayed in Eph. 3, that God would strengthen us with power into our inner man. That inner man is our spirit. Mal. 2, Jehovah says we need to take heed to our spirit. That we would not become treacherous. Living in today's age, surrounded by so many things, trying to occupy us, trying to distract us. When your spirit says don't go there, don't touch that, take heed to your spirit. Otherwise you get yourself occupied, kidnapped by so many things, frustrating the seed from growing up in you.

The seed falling on the four kinds of soil. The wayside, the seed could not get in. The soil with rocks beneath. It sprouts quickly and dies quickly. It could not root well. The soil among thorns. When the plant grows up it is chocked by the thorns. Finally the good soil, free from rocks, hardness and thorns. The plant can grow freely. We need to deal with our heart. Our heart has these four aspects, areas that need our attention. We need to make sure our heart is not hardened toward the Lord, not having the hidden sins or desires that need to be unearthed, and our heart needs to be set free from all the cares and anxieties of this life. Then our heart will be the proper ground to allow the seed to grow in us.

The problem is never on God's side. He is faithful to dispense Himself into us. Whenever you come to a meeting, to His Word, He nourishes. But after receiving His nourishment, what do we do? Do we allow the Word to go further in us, to have free access to all the parts of our mind, emotion and will. There is always the lack with the human element to render the cooperation, to supply the nutrients. So one can be a Christian for decades and the seed does not grow that much. It's not that God is not merciful or faithful, but that person's heart, his spirit, has never been opened fully to the Lord. This is serious.

How can we experience the real building? Outwardly we may be very active, but not realise the real building is going on inside. That building has been frustrated because you're heart, your spirit is not open. You do not supply the nutrients. This is not only a matter of growth but of building.

### D. growth equals building

The church was not seen until the day of Pentecost. 50 days after his death and resurrection something called the church was raised up. Between His speaking and the appearing, what did Jesus do? John 12, unless a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies it abides alone but if it dies it bears many grains. That grain was Himself that was to be sown into the earth and die. Through that unique grain being sown into the earth it reproduces into many grains. That life in the initial grain was released to become many grains. The Lord breathed Himself into the believers. The very church that appeared on the day of Pentecost is a result of the divine life being released and dispensed from that initial seed. This is how Christ builds the church. Not with a hammer and a saw to build a physical structure. To dispense His life, to breath His Spirit into His chosen people.

### E. spiritual digestion

Not something physical, not something outward. Something organic, something inward. Involves an organic process. The life has to be released and dispensed into us. That life has to go through a metabolic process in us. What is the metabolic process? Metabolism involves a receiving a new element and discharging an old element. The dead cells, the waste. Through this process of dying and resurrection, the new element comes in, the old element goes out. We grow. It's a metabolic process. In the Bible this process is called transformation. Without transformation there would be no building. This process requires us to have proper spiritual digestion, spiritual assimilation.

God is faithful to supply us. But after you receive, what do you do? Do you allow that supply to have proper digestion in you? We gather many teachings, much knowledge. Now I know this. Will you allow the Triune God to have further access in your being? Digestion is a breaking down. The food needs to be broken down. Assimilation means to be absorbed. Not often when we hear a message we would go back and pray, what shall I do? You never allow the divine trinity to really live in you and really to live with you. When you go about to do your shopping. When you are handling with your children at home and conversing with your spouse, are you living in and with the divine trinity. Some of the words you want to say, you still want to say it, because you cannot stand it anymore. Will you allow the Divine Trinity to operate in you to stop? The problem we have is with our digestion and assimilation. We gather a lot of knowledge. We do not allow the Triune God in us to carry out the building work.

### F. what was prophesied through typology in 2 Sam. 7

This is what this portion of the word means in our application. How God can obtain that organic building up of the church. I'd like to read to you 2 Sam.7 footnote 14 1

> these verses clearly unveil that the seed of man, a son of man, can become the son of god. God himself the divine one become a human seed, the seed of man, david. this seed was Jesus the son of God who was the son of god by his divnity alone. Through incarnation he became the son of god in his humanity as well. thus in christ god was constiuted into man, man was constiuttion into god as well. ... gods intention in his economuy is to make man god in life and nature... in and through resurection christ hte firstbon son of god became te life giving spirit, as such a sprit he entersinto god chosen people to dipanes himself into their being to be their inner constituton. he makes them godmane the many sons of god the mas reproduction o himself th son of god. they hte human seed become the sons of god through the metabolic process oftransforion. this is hte building up of the body of christ. by the bulidng up of man into god and god into man,the constiuting ofthe idnve lement into the human elent. this building will contstut the nj as a great corpoat goman the aggreagate totodality of all the sons of god

## III. In Ephesians 3:16-21 Paul prayed concerning the believers' inner experience of the indwelling Christ for the organic building up of the church as the Body of Christ

### A. Strengthened into the inner man

First item of Paul's prayer

### B. The Triune God is likened to a machine and He needs someone to be the operator

He will do the work. It is God who operates. But He needs someone to be the operator to activate that machine.

That was not only a prayer of Paul, that should be a prayer of all of us. Pray that prayer for the next 30 days and you will be a different person. I pray this prayer every day, every morning. I cannot go through a day without praying this. When Paul prayed that he was an operator. Paul initiated that, but God was the One who operated. If we want the inner experience of the indwelling Christ we have to begin to pray that prayer everyday.

The praying for our spirit to be strengthened is with the goal in view that Christ can make his home in our heart.

### C. we live mostly in the outer man

We are so easily distracted. As soon as we go to have breakfast and talk to your spouse. You engage in an argument and you get our of the inner man. How many minutes do we remain in the inner man. Pray, grant us to be strengthened. We are too weak to remain in our inner man.

### D. Christ has the desire to occupy every room in our heart

**Settle down**

A person who moves into a new house is one or two days. But it may take months to settle down. For Christ to move into you is easy, but for Christ to settle down in you, that is a long process. That settling down 'kata'. It goes down. Christ is not superficial. It is not a superficial matter. He is making His home. He is serious. He wants to settle *down*. As a result of His settling down, we'll be rooted, grounded. You will not be shaken, not uprooted easily. we will know what it is to be rooted. Not easily shaken by persons, matters. He has to go deep down in our being.

**Rooted, grounded**

Rooted in love, grounded in love. Lord, I'm still too easily drifting, prone to be distracted.

**3D**

Three dimensional experience. Holy of Holies a cube. Is your Christian life one dimensional or three dimensional. Some Christians only know prayer but not reading the Word, shepherding the saints. Refuse to be balanced. They don't know how to coordinate with the saints. We need to allow this Christ, who is universally great. He is the breadth, the length, the height. He is three dimensional. Our Christian life and church life should be like this. Very solid. One dimensional is not so stable. Three dimensional like a cube is very stable.

**Fullness**

The fulness is the overflow, the expression

### E. enter our mind, emotion, will

**spread**

Christ is in our spirit but not much in our mind, emotion and will. Our heart is our mind, emotion and will plus our conscience. Christ wants to spread in all these various parts. That spreading is the growth and is the building.

**Control center**

Christ is aiming at our heart. Our heart is the control center of our entire being.

**Spirit strengthened first**

If there is any need in the recovery it is that the Triune God will cause all the saints to be strengthened into the inner man. First our spirit needs to be strengthened. Then Christ will be able to make home in our hearts. To possess us, occupy us and saturate us.

**Buildable**

When Christ has made His home in our heart, we will have no problem with any brother or sister. We will be a buildable, blendable member. We have preferences. A certain part of your inner being is short of Christ. You have not allowed Christ to spread into that part of your will, your choice. If you have allowed Christ to have access to every part of your heart you will not have a problem with any saint anywhere on the whole earth.

**realise his universal dimensions with all the saints**

All the saints. No individual, no single church, can fully comprehend. We need all the churches. We cannot stay independent. We need all the saints connected, built together.

- His width. How embracing He is. He is all inclusive. 
- His length. He is without end. 
- His height. So transcending. 
- His depth. So unfathomable. 

When we are built up with other members we start to touch these dimensions. What we need is the increase of the stature of the measure of Christ. We don't want to remain babes. His Body is growing in stature. That will be the preparation, the mature bride.

**Fullness**

The highest expression of the church is the church as the fullness of Christ, the fullness of Christ. The fullness is the overflow. Filled unto, resulting in the fullness, the expression of God. We all need to have this kind of longing. May the churches in the Lord's recovery be brought into this reality.

**glory**

In the last verse, unto Him be glory in the church. In the first verse according to the riches of the Father's glory. The Father's glory refers to His divinity, what God is. He is glory. Paul's prayer is out of that divinity we would be strengthened. That glory would be imparted into us. Christ can make His home. Rooted and grounded in love. Apprehend with all the saints. Fullness. Now Paul can say, unto Him be glory in the church. Now the glory wrought into the church can be returned to God. Truly there has been glory worked into the church. Now there is glory in us that can be returned unto God.

### F. Pauls' spirit, attitude, prayer and faith

Related to the vision of the building up of the church. According to the stewardship to speak forth the economy of the mystery. As he speaks forth his ministry, he was filled with a spirit, an attitude. This captures his whole being. For this cause I bow my knees. That prayer was a kind of bursting out of that feeling of that attitude that Paul was filled with, in seeing that mystery of God's economy to such an extent concerning the church. He could have stopped at v13. But then he added that prayer from v14 on. He was filled with that vision. That became Paul's spirit, vision, attitude. We are familiar with the prayer and verses. But we are not impressed to such a degree.

Paul was obsessed with this vision. We need to become obsessed. If we have seen this vision we will have Paul's spirit, attitude, prayer and faith when we serve God in the church. This spirit is more precious than the prayer itself. He could not say or do anything else. I hope the Lord will grant us mercy to bring us to this point. To have this same spirit and attitude as the apostle Paul. That we have nothing else to pray for. Yes, we pray for other matters, but deep within we want Christ to make their home in the saints.

But to Him who is able to do super abundantly above all that we ask or think. What he prayed for is so high. But he was full of faith. He is able.

Learn to pray this prayer every day. That it would become our spirit, our attitude. Then we would really advance in the real building up of His Body in these last days.
