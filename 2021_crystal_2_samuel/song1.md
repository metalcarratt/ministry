   God's purpose is to have a kingdom
   A realm in which He can be freely expressed
   Everything He does is for this goal
   Our land, the produce, the building, is for this
   

1. God needs us to cooperate with Him
   Ones who are bound, inseperable from Him
   Working in the principle of incarnation
   To have one life, one living, one goal with Him
   
   God needs ones who / will cooperate with Him
   Who are bound, / one in heart, / inseperable from Him
   Having one life, / one living, one goal
   Working in / the principle of incarnation

2. Hannah was a woman with an ordinary human need
   But through her environment she became desperate before God
   God waited till her prayer matched His move and intention
   She prayed for a man-child who would be absolute for Him

3. The whole Triune God wants to supply us for this
   He's the land, the offerings and the tabernacle too
   He redeemed us and brought us within the veil
   As the Spirit He's working to align our heart with Him
   
   God is Triune / to supply us with Himself
   He's the land, / and the lamb / and God's dwelling place
   He shed His blood, / As the Spirit turned our heart
   Brought us within the veil / to converse before His face
