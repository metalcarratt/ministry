# Message Twelve - Spiritual Principles, Life Lessons, and Holy Warnings concerning the Enjoyment of the Good Land seen With Five Major Figures in 1 and 2 Samuel

We're looking at 1 and 2 Samuel through the glasses of God's economy.

## I. Under Eli the old Aaronic priesthood became stale and waning and God desired to have a new beginning for the accomplishment of His economy

Stale - a loss of freshness and vigour. One time we had a prophecying meeting, br Lee was trying to build up in Anaheim, he said to me the meeting was becoming somewhat of a form. I said what can we do? He said anything without the exercise of the spirit is a form. That was very helpful to me. We exercise our spirit we will be full of divine and mystical vigour. Matt. 9, the new wine. This word 'new' means new in time, recently possessed. The new life. Full of vigour. Stirring people to excitement (a genuine excitement, not strange fire).

Ezek. 36, a new heart and new spirit. Rom. 6:4, 7:6, walk in newness of life. Serve in newness of spirit. Eventually we are in the process of becoming as new as the NJ. Only God is newness. Outside of God there is no newness in the universe. The more we gain of God the more new we become. Everything that comes out of our spirit is new.

Acts 3, Peter is sharing in 19-20 and he tells the people, repent and turn that your sins may be wiped away, so that season of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord. Whenever we have the presence of the Lord we are refreshed. That word for refreshing also means cooling (like air conditioning), I saw that because in LS of Isaiah where it says Christ is like the shadow of a massive rock, br Lee said it's like air conditioning. Reviving and relieving. That brings in true joy and rest.

When the children of Israel celebrated the Passover their calendar got changed from the 7th month to the 1st month and names the month Abib, meaning something fresh is budding out of you. God desired to have a new beginning for the accomplishment of His economy.

Br Lee told me a story about Samuel Chang. Once someone came to him and said, I'm really having a hard day. Samuel said, just go to bed, have a sleep and get up and have a new beginning. We can have 365 new beginnings every year. Forget the things behind and stretch for the things before.

### A. Reject anything of staleness, oldness, luke-warmness and pride

Keep ourselves empty, open, fresh, new, living and young in the Lord. Pray that back to the Lord. (*A young man in God's plan*)

Rev. 3:15-22, speaking to Laodecia. Actually local churches but also signify periods of time in the history of the church. The only thing that can happen to Philadelphia, if it becomes degraded, is Laodecia. That epistle to Laodecia needs to be before us all the time. They were lukewarm. He was about to spew them out of His mouth. I counsel you to buy from Me the processed Triune God. Gold is the Father, white garments is Christ the Son as our subjective lived out righteousness. Eyes salve is the anointing Spirit. We need to pay the price to gain the Triune God every day. When the Lord is writting He says, be zealous therefore and repent. Literally boiling. The temperature of the Christian life should be boiling.

Luke 18:17, receive the kingdom of God like a little child. A little child is always able to receive a new thought. Not occupied with concepts and opinions.

Phil. 3:7-14, Paul was the antithesis of a contended Christian. Many years after his conversion he wanted to know Christ. To know Him. *How to be an elder and co-worker* book spoken in Chinese. English speaking brothers came with their headphones. He was so obsessed with these words, To know Him. To know Him in His three stages of His full ministry. Incarnation, inclusion, intensification. The whole span of God's New Testament Economy. Inclusion because in resurrection He became the all-*inclusive* life-giving Spirit. Every day we need a new vista of who Christ is in His full ministry. We have this class in the training. Before br Lee went to be with the Lord he instituted this class. He sees incarnation, inclusion, intensification as the contents of God's New Testament Economy. He said we need to know Christ in these three stages and we need to do a work in these three stages. The work in incarnation produces believers, the work in inclusion produces the churches and the work in intensification produces the overcomers. We need to work in all these three stages. If we are in the stage of intensification we will be produced as an overcomer and we will produce overcomers. This is what we're on the earth for. We want to know Christ is this kind of way.

Gal. 1, it pleased God to reveal His Son in Me. 2, Christ lives in me. 4, travailing in birth until Christ is formed in you. Three aspects of knowing Christ. Christ was revealed in us initially but we need this everyday. LS of Galatians has practical fellowship about how to experientially receive the revelation of the Son of God in a practical way.

Eph. 4:16, out from who the Body ... causes the growth of the Body. For the Body to grow, it takes all the Body. The Lord is recovering all of our functions. The recovery of the functioning of all the members causes the growth of the Body which is the building up of the Body in love. In Ephesians *in love* is used repeatedly. Our love for the Lord should always be fresh and new. We should love one another. When we are in love, that builds up the Body of Christ.

### B. Word of God was rare

By His mercy His Word is not rare among us. Also by His mercy we are on the proper ground. If we were not on the proper ground we would not be in the right position to receive God's Word. It's on that ground of genuine oneness that we can receive God's speaking.

The first thing a priest should do is speak for God. Exo 28:30, God spoke to the priest through the Urim and Thummim. There are 22 letters in the Hebrew Alphabet, and he names of the twelve tribes are on the stones. There are only 18 letters of the Hebrew Alphabet there. So four letters need to be made up. Those letters are the Thummim. According to our concept the stones would light up, but if you read the LS, it's actually the lights are lit and you get a message by the stones being darkened. In our experience it's true. When Paul writes a letter to Corinth the lights go dark. This problem and that problem. I'm going to share with the church in Corinth 20 fresh aspects of Christ so all their problems can be solved.

Pray short prayers. Pray short prayers. Br Lee says this again and again. Lord, I want to be a person intimate with You and knows Your heart. I only want to speak the unique and healthy teaching of God's economy. If God hears a prayer like that I believe He is very happy. How many Christians pray a prayer like that. Everything in the Bible is bequeathed to us. How do we cash in? This whole Bible is full of bequests to us. We've got all these riches here. The way we write cheques is we pray these things back to the Lord. When we pray these bequests back to the Lord the Spirit of reality guides us into all the reality of the points in these bequests. LS of Isaiah, br Lee says our spirit it the bank account for all the bequests. We pray them back to the Lord. A great secret. I'm so glad br Lee was sent here. We wouldn't know to pray read the Word. We wouldn't know about calling on the name of the Lord. When we pray read corporately we mostly repeat read. But we need private times with the Lord. And that is where we have our personal pray-reading, where we take the words in this wonderful book and make it part of our language. We personalise it. This is how we appropriate these bequests.

1 Tim. 3:4, 6:3, God's economy. The teaching which is according to godliness. Teaching of God's eternal economy.

### C. Eli taught Samuel how to listen to the Lord

One positive thing Eli taught Samuel to do. But it took Eli a period of time to realise it was God speaking to Eli. Samuel woke up and thought it was Eli, he woke Eli up, he said what do you want? Eli said go back to sleep. The voice came again. Three times. The third time Eli gets the message. This is God speaking to this young boy. He said, the next time you hear this voice say, Speak Oh Jehovah for your servant is listening. This should be our attitude in every home meeting, group meeting, prayer meeting, personal time with the Lord. When Gabriel visited Mary. I enjoy so much what she said. May it happen to me according to your word. So that's what Samuel did. The Lord did speak to Samuel. And He spoke to Samuel some very serious things to Eli and his household. When morning came Samuel opened the doors and Eli said I want you to tell me everything. You could tell he was very strong. Samuel had no choice and told Eli everything. The news is not good. Eli said, He's the Lord, He can do what He wants. I would've had a personal time and fallen on my face and fasted three days and said, Lord, what did I do wrong? I want to get right with you. It's sad. Eli didn't do that.

If you're going to speak for the Lord. All of us have to do this. Preaching the gospel, meeting with another brother or sister. We always want our speaking to be the Lord's speaking. If we want this we have to first hear the Lord's voice. Like in this meeting. We want to hear what the Spirit is speaking to the choice. All we want to hear is what the Spirit says.

Isa. 50:4-5, Lord's human living. J has given me the tongue of the instructed. Given Me the ear of the instructed that I might hear as an instructed one. He awakens me morning by morning. We need to ask the Lord, Lord wake me up tomorrow morning. Ask the Lord to wake you up. It'll make a difference.

### D. Eli disregarded the priesthood by his loose disciple of his sons

It's hard to even speak of what Eli's sons did. All I can do is read them. They are so wicked, so evil. Today we need to learn of Eli to have a high regard for what God has given us in His recovery. One time we were having an elders and coworkers time. Benson and I. Br Lee said at one point. Some brother were rebelling at that time. Benson said to me, Brother Ed, where is brother so and so siting, where is that brother sitting. I started looking around. Inside I wondered why is that brother sitting way back there. I never saw him sitting back there. I knew there was something wrong right there. Br Lee said something I'll never forget. I knew he was trying to recover a certain brother. He said, brother treasure your golden history in the Lord's recovery. Each of us has a golden history. We should treasure that. As time goes on we get more limited by the Lord. In the past I would have a butter on eight piece of toast, now it's half a piece of toast. Mary did what she could.That's what we should do. Quality is what we want. A little bit of gold is worth more than a mountain of grace. Calling on the Lord is so precious too you when you're so weak and powerless. Just say Oh Lord. It becomes precious to you. I'm so weak, so limited, but at the least I can say Oh Lord, I need You. OUr will says when you say Lord Jesus, you are in the Holy Spirit.

1 Sam 2, a man of God came to Eli and said, why do you honour your sons more than me? That convicted me very much. We should not honour anyone above the Lord. If we do, we do the person we're honouring a disservice. I always honour my physical dad. But when I got saved I honoured the Lord above anyone. But because I did that I honoured my dad even more. But Eli didn't do this.

## II. Samuel was faithful to God in all his God-given statuses and offices

### A. As a Levite he served God, as a Nazarite he kept his consecration; as a priest-prophet spoke honestly; as a judge brought in the kingship to end the age.

Is our consecration fresh, up to date today. Dave Higgins would say this a lot. A day without consecration is a wasted day. 

What He needs now is a corporate dispensational instrument. To set up His kingdom on this earth. In Daniel the great human image and the stone coming down out of heavens. That stone is the corporate smiting stone that smites the feet of that human image and the whole image is crushed and becomes like chaff and the wind blows it away so that no trace of it is found. That stone will become a great mountain that will fill the whole earth. That great mountain is the kingdom of God.

### B. Established as a prophet - an ear to hear what the Spirit says to the church

Follow the pattern of Mary who sat at the Lord's feet and was listening to His Word.

1. At the feet of *the Lord Jesus*, not anyone else
2. *At the feet*, in a humble position. If you think you're something when you're nothing you deceive yourself. We're nothing because we want Christ to be everything.
3. *Sitting down*, not busy, distracted with a wandering mind. Sometimes these iphones can contribute to having a wandering mind and vacillating thoughts. Sometimes I see someone doing this on their phone. But inwardly I think what are you doing. Just think, if the Lord was literally here, would you be doing this? Of course you wouldn't.
4. *Listening to the Lord's word*, His words are Spirit and life. The Words themselves are Spirit. Are life. Not just give but are.

### C. Enjoyed his enjoyment of the good land to the fullest

Samuel's mistake was to appoint his sons to be judges after him. Someone asked br Lee, why did Paul do this when he said something else in his epistle. Br Lee said, the only perfect saint is the Lord Jesus. I really like that.

When the children of Israel said they want a king it was an insult. Samuel's two sons gave the occasion for them to ask for that. If Samuel hadn't made the mistake, you wouldn't have had Saul, and you wouldn't have had David.

## III. Jonathan loved David, made a covenant with him and predicted that David would become the king and that the kingdom would be his kingdom

### A. Saul tried to preserve the kingdom for Jonathan but Jonathan recognised David needs to be on the throne

### B. Jonathan should have told Saul this and went to be with David

Jonathan didn't. 

### C. Jonathan lost his portion of the good land by not following David and staying with his father because of his natural affection

### D. Jonathan stood between Saul and David but should have followed David

Gen. 6, Noah's ministry was the ministry of that age. If you were in that age you would have to realise that Ark is what God is doing and want to link yourself with Noah in some way. God told Noah to make an Ark. We need to build up Christ (as the Ark) in our personal experience for the building up of the organic Body of Christ (also the Ark).

You have to recognise who you are and what your portion is in the Body. We can all minister the Word. I remember one brother who, when he ministered the Word you got so much enlightenment because he was so one with br Lee. But as soon as he lost that oneness, his usefulness wasn't.. it's very sad.

Michal despised David in her heart when he was leaping and dancing. She had no child until the day of her death. That means you have to be careful how you speak about the minster of the age.

Matt 25, one who has five, two and one talents. No-one can say he doesn't have at least one talent. The Lord has given you some divine mystical ability. A five talented one only comes along about once every 100 years. At the end of this age the Lord brought forth two five talented ones. Their ministry is the ministry to raise up the talent of all the members. IF you add five one talented ones you have one five talented. Br Lee said if every one talented one brought forth their talent the whole earth would be taken.

Br Lee shared in *The Vision of the Age*. Andrew translated these messages. As soon as I read that we began having conferences on that. I got up to give one message.

Watchman Nee's book, *What are we?*

Justification by faith isn't the up to date truth, but the up to date truth includes justification by faith.

Job knew something was hidden in God's heart but he didn't know what is was. Eph. 3:9 the economy of the mystery hidden in God. Whatever we're passing through, the reason for it is God's economy. This is the up to date truth.  Eph. 5:32 this mystery is great, but I speak with regard to Christ and the church.

## IV. Saul was chosen by God and anointed by Samuel to be the king of Israel 

### A. Disobeyed God's word at least twice

Ron shared on the Amalekites. Samuel comes back and Agag is still alive. Samuel was shocked. He said obedience is the number one thing. You've disobeyed God. Samuel got his sword out and Agag was gone. The Amalekites were really easy.

### B. Rebellion is like the sin of divination

When you rebel against God it's the same as divination. You're in contact with evil spirits. We have His life of obedience. We shouldn't think we can't obey. We can contact this One who always obeys.

Teraphim - household idols.

### C. Selfish and usurped God's kingdom to build up his own monarchy

This is a picture of doing a work within the work.

### D. God gave up Saul and cut him off

v27-v28. Samuel was leaving Saul. Saul seized the corner of Samuel's cloak. Samuel's cloak tore. Samuel said, J has torn the kingdom of Israel away from you this very day and given it to an associate of yours who is better than you.

### E. Israel suffered defeat against the Philistines

### F. God's fair judgment - death of Saul and his sons and armour bearer

### G. strong warning - not do a separate work

## V. David was chosen and anointed by God through Samuel to be the king of Israel

### A. Not proud or ambitious for the kingship

### B. Feared God and would not touch God's anointed

Rom. 12:3, shouldn't think more highly of ourselves as we ought to think but so as to be sober minded as God has appointed a measure of faith.

If I think my measure of faith is as great as br Lee's measure of health, I need psychological health. If you think you have the same measure as Paul you are not sober-minded. Brother who were not sober-minded annuled the proper order in the Body and what came out was rebellion and disorder.

### C. denying himself

### D. enjoy the good land

### E. he and God had only one kingdom

### F. David established by God

### G. Take care of the sense of the Lord's presence 

Take care of the inward sense of the Lord and the outward confirmation of the environment.

Jacob settled in Shechem. God wanted him to settle in Bethel. A lot of unfortunate events happened. That made it possible for Jacob to return to Bethel. It forced Jacob to return to Bethel.

### H. Negatively, destroyed by the lust of the flesh
