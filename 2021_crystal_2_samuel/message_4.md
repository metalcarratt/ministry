# Message Four - The history of the Ark and the Tabernacle

A marvelous revelation in this message that covers the entire of church history. **VII** - the history of the Ark and the tabernacle is a pre-figure of church history.

Two big burdens in this message. The first point is related to the Ark. We have to see what the Ark is. Keep in mind five key words: center, content, wood, gold, cover.  The center and content - a pillar. The wood and the gold - a pillar. The materials of the Ark. Humanity and Divinity. Then the cover.

Second point is the history. Five points, aspects, positions, stages, situations. Will get to that.

Message three has this phrase: spiritual lessons, life lessons and holy warnings. I hope we would look for these things in this message too. Learn the life lessons and heed the holy warnings. 1 Cor. 10:11, everything that occurred to Israel happened as an example for us. They were written for our admonition. They are not just stories, they are related to us and our going on.

## I. Christ has gained us so that we might gain Him in order for God to be built into us and for us to be built into Him to become a corporate God-man, the reality of the church as the tabernacle of God, which is the house of the living God, the mutual abode of God and man.

The tabernacle is a type both of Christ and the church. How does the tabernacle expand from Christ to the church? Through His building Himself into us and us into Him. He is doing this today, even right now, working on this mutual abode. I hope even in this hour.

## II. In order to enter into the reality of the Body of Christ we must see the intrinsic significance of the Ark

### A. The Ark - God's presence

The Israelites all considered the Ark as God's presence. Where the Ark went, God went. When the Ark was going, Jehovah rise. When the Ark was coming back, return Oh Jehovah. This is a type of Christ. When Christ came to tabernacle among men, if you want to find God you had to go to that man. He is our Immanuel. 

### B. Center and content

Center and content of the tabernacle. Christ as the center and content of the church. Christ occupies the place of pre-eminence in the church.

We could say Christ is our center but no glory. We could lose the tabernacle. We need to make sure in our Christian life, church life, service, Christ is our center. Don't be tempted just to pray in perfunctory way. Always be on guard. In all our service Christ must be the center.

The law is not just a set of commands. The law is a testimony. The law tells us what God is like. Christ is the definition, the description of God the explanation of God. If you want to know God look at Christ. If you want to know what God's like, come to the church. But only if Christ is our center and our content.

The Ark was not at the physical center but at the inmost part. Scripturally the inmost part is the center. Brother Lee has a diagram which matches the three parts of the tabernacle to the three parts of man. The Holy of Holies corresponds to the spirit. Where is the Ark? In the Holy of Holies. Today, in our spirit. When God comes into us He comes not only as the Lamb but as the Ark. I hope we can appreciate this. 

Apart from Christ there is no way to contact God. In the Holy of Holies is only one item, that little box, the Ark. In the church should be just one item, only Christ. The NT tells us how to have the proper church. Acts 8:1, 13:1 Rev. 1:11. The way the church should be is on the ground of oneness. But if we go this way does it mean we are the testimony? Is there an Ark? Is Christ the content? We must have Christ as the reality, the embodiment of God's testimony.

### C. Wood and gold

2 Tim 4:22, the Lord be with your spirit.

Have you had much realisation that he's the indwelling Ark? The Ark is crucial. A key verse is Exo. 25:22, *And there I will meet with you and speak with you from above the expiation cover, from between the two cherubum ... there I will meet with you.* The Lord only meets with us on Christ. We need to know where 'there' is. In our spirit.

Many verses from the gospels show the Lord's humanity with its character and standing. If you would spend time to read through you will see the beautiful humanity of Christ.

Matt. 3:16, To fulfil all righteousness. If I'm a man, in this dispensation, I shouldn't be an exception. Not being an exception is part of that wonderful humanity. We always wish we could be an exception. "Cut me some slack."

Matt. 4:4 he kept His position as a man when the enemy tempted Him.

8:20 did not insist on His comfort.

On and on. He's merciful and lowly of heart. Smoking flax He would not quench. Isn't He beautiful. Flexible, His serving spirit, his diligence, his willingness to be restricted by time.

All of this is in the Spirit of Jesus for us to appropriate and experience. All His experiences and attainments are included. Now we can eat Him and live because of Him. His humanity can be lived out in us. I hope that we would realise this picture of the Ark shows that humanity is the basis for God's expression. God wants to be expressed in humanity. The lid was all of gold. But the rest of the Ark was actually wooden. But when you look at it you don't see any wood, only gold. Outside and inside. So the wood was enveloped, wrapped in gold. Even though the expression should be golden. The holding power is wood. That shows that humanity is important for God's testimony. We are living in an age where the attack on humanity is blatant. Even when I was a teenager I could see this around me. The humanity of the young people is Satan's target.

Book: Christ as the reality. pp 124.

> Satan's main target today is the young people. there are more mental cases among the young people than ever before. The source of all their concepts and moves are Satan. The attack is through the mentality. We need to pray against this Satanic tendency among today's young people. Satan is so subtle he inject his mentality into the young people. The Bible speaks so much of having a sound mind. Do you believe the mentality of the younger generation is unhealthy. All the young brother and sister must be clear the source of this damage is the mentality. Repudiate the concepts you had in the past. You must give it up. It may be something of Satan to damage your mentality. Fornication, suicide and mental illness.

A word of warning to the young people and all of us. We need to pray for the proper humanity for the Lord's testimony.

### D. Cover

Propitiatory cover - expiation cover - mercy seat. The thought is that because of the redemption of Christ and blood that is sprinkled on the cover, God now has the ground to meet with His redeemed. There is a seat where He can come and talk with us. Isn't that wonderful.

Rom. 3:25, whom God sent forth as a propitiation place

God put Christ as the cover. The Ark is a type of Christ, but the cover itself is also a type of Christ. "It is *there* I will meet with you and speak with you."

There's the one who propitiates, the propitiatory sacrifice. Christ is both. Then He is the propitiatory cover, the place. He's the one who does it, the sacrifice and the place where it takes place.

Lord, thank You that You are the propitiatory cover. Without You there is no place I can meet with God. How can the righteous God meet with us?

The **blood of sprinkling**. What is this? The offers were offered on the altar in the outer court. That is a type of the cross for our redemption. Some of that blood was brought into the Holy of Holies and sprinkled there seven times on the cover and before the Ark. The blood is for entering, not just for forgiveness, it's for entry. Saints, come forward. Don't delay. Many in Christianity only knew the cross. We didn't realise the blood is for entry. In the Lord's recovery I found out about my spirit. We must come to our spirit. We must come to the Ark. Don't linger at the altar. We always will appreciate the altar. There is a Lamb on the throne. But come forward. The blood is sprinkled on the propitiatory cover. On the cover you have the two cherubim, representing God's glory.

**Cherubim and the blood**. The Cherubim points to God's glory, the blood to redemption. This shows us that when God comes to meet with us. He comes *there*. He doesn't see the law. The law is covered. He doesn't see our sin. He sees the blood. That blood gives Him the ground to meet with us. The Christ who lives in us is the One portrayed by the Ark with the cover. Today He is the indwelling Ark with the cover. No matter how many failures we've had, how many defeats we've had, we can come to Christ, we can come to God. He has the ground to meet with us and we have the ground to enjoy Him. Firstly God has the standing of the blood and we have the standing of the blood. Often we pray we are under His blood. But strictly speaking we are on the blood. God is sitting on the blood, there, meeting with us.

This propitiating cover is the **throne of grace**. Even in Samuel, when the elders usurped the Ark, they said, He is the One enthroned between the cherubim. That means on the propitiation cover. So we can *come* to this throne of grace. To receive mercy and to find grace. And then we're in glory. Even you're maybe there weeping but you're in glory. We knew we were not only forgiven, but somehow we're in glory. This should be our experience every time we come to the Lord in our private fellowship with Him. In principle God only meets with us in glory. In our meetings, don't you have this sense?

**Glory and redemption**.

Our experience should be from glory to glory. Then He speaks to us. We hear His voice. We learn His hearts desire. We receive vision, we receive direction for our lives. He is mingling with us. There. *There*.

The function of the Ark depends on the cover. The usefulness depends on the cover. *Because* of the cover God becomes our enjoyment.

## III. The history of the Ark and the tabernacle portrays the desire of God's heart, the desolation of the church, and the recovery of the church for God's testimony

Five stages.

### First stage - the Ark *in* the tabernacle

The Ark was in the tabernacle. But the Ark was separated from the tabernacle. The church lost the presence of God. It's possible to have an Ark-less tabernacle. A Christ-less church. Laodicea the Lord was outside the church knocking. He's trying to get back in.

In Joshua the Ark led the way to cross the Jordan, to defeat Jericho. But they used their past experiences. It was not Joshua who initiated, it was Jehovah.

During Israel's fight with the Philistines, God did not intend to move. This usurped the headship. They usurped God, forcing Him to go with them for their safety, peace and comfort. "Lord, I'm doing such and such this weekend. Give me good weather." We force the Ark. Is that God's desire? We should enquire. We don't want "Ichabod" situations.

This doesn't mean we shouldn't pray for the things that relate to us, but we should pray like Hannah. She had a need but realised God had a need. She prayed, Lord, meet my need and in meeting my need, meet Your need.

Today men are replacing God's testimony with man's need. The Ark is for the testimony, not for our blessing.

### Second stage - degraded and lost reality

Formal Christendom with the name of God but with no reality. Even for centuries. Trusting in the systems ordained by God. It was the elders of Israel who initiated this. Brothers, we need to be careful. We shouldn't trust in the systems ordained by God, in outward things, even some other localities blessing. We have to go to the Lord. Let Him initiate.

Joshua 9 - they did not ask for the counsel of Jehovah.

Pray **III. L** to the Lord. When we are sick, instead of immediately praying for healing. Lord, why this? Do you know that as a human being, you can know what is in God's heart in God's mind? Not here for my health, prosperity, safety, profit, health, job, well-being. Lord, what is in your heart concerning me?

To be Ark-less is to be Christ-less. Ichabod, no glory. We don't want Ichabod. We don't want, "Behold I stand at the door and knock"

### Third stage - recovered but without the proper church life (IV)

A better situation but still not normal. Throughout church history there were faithful ones who saw through the degredation. They had Christ in their lives, in their home. Among us we don't want anything to do with formal religion as it is Ark-less. My own mother was in the denominations. She would encourage me to go to the meetings. But in the later years she just stayed home and read her Bible. Until the Lord brought her to the church life.

Saints, I'm a little concerned because of the situation in many places, the saints are isolated and meeting online. Be careful never to be satisfied that you can just enjoy Christ in your home. We need the church life. Not only we. God needs the tabernacle. You may be satisfied, but He is not satisfied.

### Fourth stage (V) - Christ with an inadequate church

David moved the Ark to the city which was improved, but still not into the tabernacle. Some start a church. They have a meeting. But sooner or later, many such situations have a sense, there has got to be more. Not the assurance this is totally the right thing. Groups of seeking believers that are brought to the churches in their localities. Be careful of "pitching your own tent".

David's heart was good, but his first attempt was totally wrong (tried the same way as the Philistines). God didn't condemn the Philistines but He judged God's people when they did it.

1 Kings 3, Solomon. v 15. Then Solomon awoke and behold it was a dream and he went to Jerusalem and stood before the Ark of the covenant. He left the Ark-less tabernacle and went to the Ark, and shortly after the temple was built

### Fifth stage (VI) - Christ with a proper church

Solomon built the temple and the Ark was moved back into the Holy of Holies

## VII The history of the Ark and the tabernacle is a prefigure of church history, giving us a portrait of the course and situation of the church from the very beginning to the present time; there are five main aspects of this history

Don't lose your first love. If the Lord is outside and knocking, open the door. Let Him in.

Come back to the propitiation cover to meet with Him. Where He can meet with us and shine on us.

When God is at home there is rest in our spirit. May we cooperate with the Lord for this. Do you see the five positions? The first one completely right, the second empty. The third, good but abnormal. The fourth half.

The Lord is recovering the original position but working to make it expanded and more solid.





# Qs

1. What are the five key words related to the Ark, and what is the spiritual significance of each one?

center, content, wood, gold, cover

- center and content: God is the center of the tabernacle and it's content. Christ is the reality of the tabernacle, the church and our human being.
- wood and gold: the human and divine natures of Christ. Wood is the uplifted perfect humanity as the base and gold is the divine nature.
- cover: the propitiation place, enabling us to come forward to God

2. Why is having a proper humanity important in relation to the church being God's testimony?

Humanity is the basis for God's expression.

1. Explain how in our experience the function and usefulness of the Ark are altogether dependent on the propitiatory cover (in your answer, include references to the "two cherubim of gold" and the "blood of sprinkling").
2. Explain how the history of the Ark and the tabernacle is a prefigure of church history, giving us a full portrait of the course and situation of the church from the very beginning to the present time in your answer, include the give main aspects of this history).
3. How can we ensure that we would not be persons who usurp God but, rather, be persons, like Hannah and Samuel, according to God's heart and for His economy?
