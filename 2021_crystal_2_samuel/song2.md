# Poem 2
```
Hannah's way is to bring in the King
It's the narrow path, the way of suffering
Travailing in birth to bring forth a man child;
The overcomers who can turn this age

Hannah was afflicted and bitter in soul
She was anxious and provoked as she came before God
She poured out her soul without pretense before Him
She cast Him, the tree, into her bitter waters

Hannah's prayer echoed God's move
She prayed for a Nazarite, a man child
This Nazarite would bring in the King with the kingdom
How much we need a prayer life like this!

The overcomers are Zion, the beauty of the church
They are the beachhead through which the Lord will return
We need to fight to pray for and gain such ones
Living a prayer life in the light of the Lord's second coming
