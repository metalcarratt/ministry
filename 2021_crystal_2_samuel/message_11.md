## I. First Samuel 25:1b-44 is a record of David's dealing with Nabal and Abigail

1 Samuel 25:1-2

> now there was a man who's possession were in Carmel and the man was very wealthy, he had 3000 hseeps and a 1000 goats. The man's name was Nabal and the wife's name was Abigail. And the woman had good discernment and bueatiful in appearance. BUt the man was hard and evil in his doings. And he was a Calebite.

### A Abigail's wisdom

Abigail's wisdom. David with his army were watching over all the sheep shearers serving Nabal. Then David sent several of his soldiers to contact Nabal and make a request. We are caring for the ones working for you. Would you please give us some food and milk. Nabal was outraged. That report was brought to David. He made a decision. I will take 400 soldiers and we will go to attack and by the end of tomorrow there will not be one male living there. But someone also went to Abigail to let her know what was coming. She arranged to have all kinds of food and life supply and went to contact David with this.

> And when Abigail saw David she hurried and got off her donkey and bowed hersel to the ground and said upon me alone be this inquity and let your femail servant speak in your hearing. May my lord not take this worthless man Nabal to heart. For as his name is so he is. Nabal is his name and folly is with him. But I your female servant did not see my lord's young men. And now my lord, as Jehovah lives, and as your soul lives, since Jehovah has withheld you from entering into bloodshed and from avenging yourself from your own hand, now therefore let your enemies and those who seek harm be like Nabal. Now this present, let it be given to the young men. Please forgive hte transgression of your femail servant. For Jehovah will no doubt make a sure house for my lord, bcause my lrod fights the battle of jehovah and no evil will be found in you throughout your days And though men rise up to seek your life, my lord's life will be bound up with Jehovah and your enemies he will sling out. And when Jehovah has done to my lord according to all the good he has spoken to you and se you ruler over israel, this will not be a stumbling block to you, that you shedblood without cause. Maybe you remember your female servant.

### B. David's response.

32-35

> And David said to Abigail, blessed be J the God of Israel, who sent you this day to me and blessed be your discrection and blessed be you who kept me this day from enetering inot bloodshed and avenging myself by my own hand. For surely as J the God of Israel lives, unless you had hurried and come to meet me, indeed there would not have been left to Nabal one male. SO David took from her hand what she brough to him and he said to her go in peace ot your house, see I have heard your voice and accepted your voice

### C. David caught by Abigail's beauty and wisdom

36-42

> Abigail went to Nabal and just as he was having a feast in his house, like the feast of a kind, and Nabal's heart was merry within him, he was extremely drunk. She told him nothing until the light of morning. IN the morning when the wine had left Nabal his wife told him these things and his heart dies within him and he became a stone. About 10 days laters J struck Nabal and he died. And when David heard... blessed be J who has ... withheld his servant from evil doing ... and David sent men to propose to Abigail that he might take her to himself as wife. And when David's servants came to Abigail at Carmel ... David has sent us to you to take you to himself as wife. And she rose up and fell on her face ot teh ground and she said here is your female servant, as a slave to wash the feet of my lord's servants. and abigail hurried and rose up and rode o na donkey with five young women following her and she became his wife.

She is beautiful, that's clearly mentioned. But that's not the emphasis. It's her wisdom, her perception. Not trying to speak to her husband while he was drunk. Jehvoah himself took action. Both fully aware of Jehovah as their God. What a wonderful picture of what the warrior wife will be. She's a picture of what we will be in this aspect of the church.

## II. David typifies the warring Christ in the midst of sufferings

Abigail is very clear by accepting David's wife she will be his counterpart in the midst of warfare. She will realise my husband David is engaging in warfare in the midst of sufferings. I will live a life of sufferings with him as we are fighting the battle for God's kingdom on earth. They were not holding anything back. Oh, can I have a lovely apartment in the palace. No. I am your counterpart warrior. I'll e with you wherever you go. IN the midst of your sufferings.

### A. David typifies the LJ as a man on earth in his sufferings

### B. Type of the warrior Christ

She said, you are engaged in warfare for God's interest on the earth. Not doing this for yourself. She didn't want anything for herself. She was drawn by Jehovah God Himself to be one with David the warring king in his sufferings.

### C. Jehovah is our triumph, our victory

The real warrior is not any human being. Just a Godman Jesus is fighting. He is fighting for us right now. He's our warrior, He's our victory, but He needs a match. He needs a wife as a counterpart. He needs her. He doesn't say I'm the conqueror and I can take care of a lion, a bear, a giant, I've been victorious in one battle after another. Why do I need a female to help? There's a sense, I need this woman. I've never met anyone like her. I want her to be my wife. So, she agreed. She didn't wait for what was supposed to be a year. She went.

### D. Christ is the warrior

We personally and corporately need to know this aspect of Christ. We may have to go against our disposition or allow the cross to deal with our natural fighting disposition. The Lord needs this kind of fighting companion now. He will have the warrior wife when he returns only if the warrior wife is maturing and learning by experience now. Otherwise he'll have to wait because His Abigail is not here.

When He comes He will obliterate all the rebellion and lawlessness on the earth. The Lord will come with His warrior wife. I believe with my whole being this will happen. We have an opportunity to be part of this aspect of the church.

Antichrist and the false prophet will be case into the lake of fire. Christ will distribute the co-kings across the earth. But the victory in battle happens first. Christ will come with His bride as His army. He's not going to fight alone. As God He could do that. But His way is to have the real David and the real Abigail.

### E. Victorious Christ

We need to know Christ in these two aspects. Not just doctrinally. 

As a man He defeated the devil and His works. Resurrection - cast out the ruler of this world.

Col. 2:15, during the 2nd three hours Christ was on the cross the enemy began to realise, I'm being destroyed. SO there was a spiritual warfare around the cross. The enemy sent his principalities and powers. The Lord terminated them on the cross. Put to shame all these evil powers. We are blest to have that verse in Colossians opened up to us. The one with the source of death was being destroyed. It's beyond our capacity to understand. We just need to praise Him. 

We are not just here physically. According to Eph. 2:6 we have been raised together with Christ and now we're seated in the heavenlies in Christ *right now*. He led us captive, those who had been taken captives. He released us from the usurping hand of Satan and brought us to the highest place in the universe. Lord, I was usurped but you came and found me, delivered me. You brought me to the heavenlies. Praise the victorious Christ! Praise the transcendent Christ.

Armageddon - this will happen. We hope that we will be there.

## III. Abigail typifies the warring church in the midst of suffering

Not just the warring church. It's in the midst of suffering. Paul understood this fully. Gal. 1:24, making up what's lacking of the sufferings of Christ for the Body.

### A. Abigail always at the side of David the warrior

How precious is this. For him to realise my companion is here. At my side. She's not reluctant in any way. She's not ruled by fear. I have to take the lead, she knows that. But I need her. I can't be warrior and the victor without her. What a privilege we have to be the warrior wife.

Eph. 5, the wife, the great mystery the church. She's the wife. But in ch 6 the wife is the warrior. Isn't the NT wonderful. Rev. 19, the marriage. Rejoice and exult. His wife has made herself ready. Then there's a wedding feast. And then there's the bridal army, with General Jesus. To engage the army at Armageddon.

### B. One with Christ in His sufferings

We know he's still suffering. Saul of Tarsus. Why are you persecuting Me? His believers, some of them were being killed, put in prison. He's not just far away saying, Oh, look what's happening to them and speaks to the angels, do you see what's going on? He's full of feeling. You persecute Me. What they suffer I suffer. So we know from Acts 7, when Stephen is near the end, the Son of Man was standing up. Our brother saw Him and what did the Lord see? He saw His reproduction living our His victorious death. How he prayed, Lord, forgive them, they don't know what they're doing. At the very end, Lord, receive my spirit. Exactly how the Lord prayer. The Lord needs, and I mention sisters first, because they're deeper than brothers. They will have the sense there is pain in the body. There is suffering in the body. The Lord is suffering in the body. The prayer will flow out to touch the throne because of this.

We are fighting in the midst of suffering. Some are afraid of the fighting, others are afraid of the suffering. The only fear we have is the fear of God. How wise of God to use a female to deal with the enemy of His behalf.

Some cultic groups think we need to suffer our way into redemption. No, only the Godman Jesus suffered in this way, on our behalf. There's a second kind of suffering, for producing and building the church ,which needs to be filled by the apostles and the believers. The body will not be built up if there are not brothers and sisters today who are Abigails. We're not praying for sufferings, but we know this is part of our married life as the bride.

The feeling in me is so deep. In your spirit you can sense what cannot be spoken. The Lord needs this kind of counterpart.

Stewardship can only be carried out in sufferings. We are not focused on sufferings. A man in the spirit. The genuine ministry is composed of revelation plus sufferings. In our hearts, Lord, raise up brothers and their counterparts that are willing to take this way. That we not only have capable brothers, gifted and trained brothers, we have stewards, servants, ministers, who paid the price. Only the Lord know, I'm aware of some who've taken this way, and their wives joined them in taking this way. There's a suffering the produces the ministry and then there's a suffering that enables the ministry to be carried out. We do this because it's out of love. We're His counterpart. We are intrinsically one.

We don't focus on suffering, but it has to part of our understand of what the Lord need in His recovery among us. In these rare occasions where a brother serving in this way marries a sister and in the courtship it's very clear, if you marry me I will love you all the time, but if you marry me, you'll take the way of suffering. Part of my life on the earth is to take this way as part of Abigail.

Are we willing? We know from scripture like Luke 12, count the cost ahead of time. You want to build a tower? Are you able to complete it? If you're not able to complete it, don't start. Your in war and you have an army of 10,000 against 20,000, you have to consider are you able to fight it? This whole generation from 12 years old and up that the Lord will need to consummate the age, the Lord must put it in them, this is not an easy way. If you want an easy way you're going another direction. It's not the easy way, but it's the blessed way.

### C. participation in spiritual warfare

The warrior is not in Eph 1 or 2. Body, fullness of God. Ch 4, the new man and the Body. Not in ch5, we have the counterpart. But once he has the counterpart he knows he has the warrior. Because he would not have married her if he did not know she's fully ready.

In Rev. 9: 7-9, there's an emphasis on the wedding garment. Composed of righteousnesses. Then there's the turn. On our way to war. We don't know what she will say, but she might say, Dear, we're going to war. What should I put on? Maybe the Lord would say, your wedding dress is your uniform. Just come as you are. Oh, we are really going to shock the enemy when husband and wife descend as the army, when I want to execute my judgment I'm going to ask you to do it. You be my representative. It really humbles a proud male human being to be defeated by a female. The Lord is not just coming alone as a mighty general. Using his omnipotence as God. He's coming with her.

Lord, give us the prayers we will need for the church to become a warrior.

S.S. 4, the husband to be speaks about her neck is like the tower of David and has all kinds of weapons in it. The Lord, through transformation has renewed not only the mind and emotion but they are one on the level of the will. No compromise. To the foe the word is always no, to the Father, yes. We need to be aware the Lord has the target in renewing us, he begins with the mind and spread into the emotion. The will needs to be subdued to be neither a noodle or an iron rod. It will be in harmony with Him. It's a battle of will in the universe. The Lord needs people who are one will with Him.

The will of the enemy will be subdued through Abigail. The victory of Christ will be expressed and applied through Abigail. So she needs to be in harmony with Him on the level of the will. He will arrange certain things that will go away our natural life, we have to be honest, I don't know how I can do this, but within is an echo, Your will be done. Can this cup pass from me? I live for the will of the Father. Not my will but yours be done.  When Peter tried to fight the Lord said the cup the Father has given me, shall I not drink it? This is the one will. Let's just be honest. We're all in the process. We will all have a will like a tower of David and the weapons of warfare are there.

5 - When will the years of battle start? Mainly fought by prayer. Also when preaching the gospel, raising up churches, strengthening churches. Have you ever heard a gospel message among us that tells people to repent? A different view, a different concept. The king is near. We should not be afraid to speak the gospel in this kind of warfare.

## IV. The type of Abigail portrays a believer who goes forth unto Jesus outside the camp, bearing His reproach

Another viewpoint. 

I graduated from the seminary in 1964. For two years I was seeking the Lord for His will, I was under his dealing in all kinds of ways. I realised this is the Lord's leading. The Lord wants me to be in California. A friend of mine invited me to come give a sermon in Prebyterian chruch. he was hoping me to be theri pastor. This is the last message I gave before I said goobye to the whole system. Heb. 13. I said, I don't know where, hat you will do, or where you will go, but I'm going to Jesus outside the camp. I didn't really know what I was saying. I didn't just leave one denomination. I left the whole system of organised Christianity. The whole system is a camp. The Jesus I love is not in the camp. He's outside the camp. Eventually I had to learn the full picture in Hebrews. First you go within the veil and just have face to face fellowship in glory. They you're supplied. And then you go ourside the camp with the suffering Jesus. This is also Abigail.

### A. Christian life has inward and outward aspect

Shulamite - inward aspect. She can live in the Holy of Holies, constituted of the resurrection life, resting in joyful way

Abigail - outward aspect.

Christ was crucified outside. Inside we enjoy the resurrected Christ and outwardly we follow Jesus. We are those who follow the Lamb wherever He may go.

Bearing His reproach. We are one with Him. I will not separate myself from Him. We are not ashamed to be identified with Him.

### B. Everyday we can experience these two aspects

Within the veil living in the Holy of Holies, beholding Him. Outside the camp, living in the world and following the lowly Jesus. Here we are in the anti-God world. We're not ashamed to be what we are. We're not asking for an easy-going pseudo-Christian country.

Within - the resurrected Christ. Without - Jesus the Nazarene.

Inwardly - Shulamite within the veil. Without - Abigail's public living.

We're not ashamed of the gospel of God. Not ashamed of Jesus. Not ashamed of those who love Him. Call me what you want. It will bounce of me. It can't touch me. But if you want to know a little bit, my real name is Abigail.

### C. when we come out from within the veil we are able to take the way of the cross to follow the suffering Jesus

None of us can bear what is coming each day. We begin each day within the veil. Not a routine. We really want to be revived by beholding the glory of the Lord. I just want to be here and gaze on You. I can't live without being infused by You. Then you are enabled to go outside the camp and follow the suffering Jesus.

Only those who enter within the veil can go forth unto Jesus outside the camp and bear His reproach. It is the resurrected Christ in us who leads us to follow the suffering Jesus.

Now we have a complete picture of Abigail. She is beautiful. The Lord will beautify all of us. She had wisdom. She loved her husband. She was committed to follow Him wherever she went. In order to really be His warrior wife, she really needs to be Shulamite-Abigail. May the Lord Spirit move steadily but gently and continually in the lives of hundreds and thousands of saints so this message becomes more than a message but an inner reality. When Abigail is ready the heavens will rejoice. Our David, our Bridegroom, our Lord Jesus will come for His Abigail and bring her to the throne and the wedding feast begins. And we will have the honour to return with Him to the earth to deal with the enemy.

What the Lord has spoken He will work out in any saint who is willing and open to have the experiences needed for the Lord to have His Abigail. We have the opportunity to be part of it. How blest we are.
