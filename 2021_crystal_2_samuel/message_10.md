# Message Ten - David, Mephibosheth, and the Kindness of God

The subject today is exceedingly heartwarming, pleasant, tender, gentle. It is deeply moving and inspiring. The topic or the story is the David, Mephibosheth and the kindness of God. The kindness of God. Right away I would come to three verse in the NT that would describe God's kindness toward us.

Rom.2:4, *Or do you despise the riches of His kindness.* I hope we would all praise God for the riches of God's kindness. And forebearance, longsuffering. God's kindness is what led us all to repentance. Consider, muse, reflect on this for a moment. What led us to repentance? God's kindness. That kindness is rich to the uttermost. It's inclusive. It includes so many things, that is a display to this whole universe of how good, how kind, how affectionate God is toward us sinners.

Eph. 2:7, *that He might display in the ages to come the surpasses riches of His grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus.* One day God will display, make an exhibition, in the ages to come, the coming kingdom age and the age of eternity. What does He want to show and display to the universe? The surpassing riches of His grace in kindness toward us. That means this kindness will be forever memorable. This kindness, this grace. It's not only His grace but His grace that comes in kindness toward us. This grace from God came with a certain kind of attitude and inward feeling, a certain kind of heart. Not just grace that comes to us, but it came in a certain way, with a certain feeling. That is kindness. His kindness was directed toward us. God is kind toward us, brothers and sisters.

Titus 3:4-5 *but when the kindness and love to man of our Saviour God appeared* there was a time when this kindness and love of our saviour God appeared. Somewhat it was hidden before that time. The time came and that kindness showed itself, was revealed, was seen, was experienced. It appeared. *not out of works in righteousness we did but out of mercy He saved us*. Along with kindness we have the mercy of God. Grace is indespensible. But here the word that is used is kindness and mercy. That simply means one thing. We are absolutely totally unworthy of His salvation, of His love. It takes something more far reaching for us to be saved. Mercy reaches further than grace. The way it came to us is so kind, so good, so pleasant.

I like to just refer you back to the hymns that we sang.

Hymn #26

> God we praise thee for thy mercy
> Tis so great and so profound
> In our weakness and our failures

(how crippled and lamed we are)

> With its greatness it abound

> How we marvel at this mercy
> So far reaching and so vast.

We are sinners, transgressed against God. A bunch of people defiled, living in unrighteousness. We don't deserve anything. We deserve to die. Yet God loved the world but not only so, He had to reach us, to reconcile, even His enemies. Mephibosheth's grandfather was Saul the King, the chief enemy of David. As such he was David's enemy. How much we have all become at odds with God, at enmity with God. God would reach out to reconcile us with Himself. It is not mercy, I don't know what is mercy.

> It has reached us even the sinners
> And will ever hold us fast
> From this mercy what can cause us to be cast?

We all really become the vessels of mercy

> Oh thy mercy so inspiring
> gentle, tender, dear and sweet
> With they patience and thy kindness
> Us in all our need it meets
> It we treasure, nothing can with it compete

Hymn #31,

> All that we were our sin our guilt was all our own

An accurate description of us sinners

> All that we are we owe to thee thou God of grace alone
>
> Thy mercy found us in our sins

The king David asked his assistants, he asked a three word question, the same question God asked in the garden of Eden. "Where is he?" Do you hear in those three little word the love? The mercy? Do you hear that? To Adam God would say, "Where are you?" God is asking this question just like David. It was not to come to find him and kill him and judge him. Mephibosheth may have thought so. David wanted to do something for him to show kindness to him. God asked the question of Adam in the same way. I want to find you. To save you. These three words are surely the beginning of the good tidings. It must be the three words that under-girded every message of the gospel. Where are you? Where is he? That mercy found us all.

> And gave us to believe
> Oh God, how rich how vast thy love
> Thy love is past man's finding out
> That I may know how much I know to thee

Nothing we can ever do can repay God's mercy and kindness toward us. Never. We will always the object not only of His love but of His mercy in kindness.

Yet another hymn. Hymn #296

> can it be that I can gain an interest in the saviour's blood?
> Amazing love! How can it be? That thou my God should die for me?
> He left His father's throne above, so free so infinite his grace
> Emptied himself of all his love..
> tis mercy all ... for Oh my God, He found out me.

His love and grace in kindness that discovered us and located us exactly where we were in our sinful, deadness, paralysed, sick situation. Mercy found us out. It came in torrents of kindness from God. Through eventually the death of His Son we were saved and we received His grace in that salvation.

Kindness in Greek means - goodness, kindness, gentleness. A description of God's heart and attitude. Just the word 'kind' in our human terms, means sympathetic, helpful, forbearing, gentle, pleasant, tender-hearted, warm, affectionate, loving. This word kindness actually includes all these thing. We are hear talking about the kindness of God. All these things that are the definition of kindness came to us, in a surpassingly rich way. I am just bathing, enjoying God's kindness toward me. Filled with gratitude, thankfulness, worship, toward God who was kind toward us. Not only before we were saved. In eternity He will exhibit this kindness toward us. In a non stop way.

Another definition in the ministry, the kindness of God is *the benevolent goodness that issues out of the mercy and love of God*. I really really like this definition.

## I. Second Samuel 9:1-13 is a record of David's showing kindness to Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan

David asked is there anyone left in the house of Saul that I may show kindness for Jonathan's sake. Jonathan cared for David and did many things to rescue and save David. Jonathan made a covenant with David, While I'm still alive, do show me the loving kindness of Jehovah. Never cut off your loving kindness from my house. Jonathan made this covenant with the house of David in this way. For Jonathan's sake, David was looking for some descendants from the house of Saul. There was another time where David had an opportunity to kill Saul, as a God-fearing person under authority. But he left Saul know he could have done this. Saul said, swear to me by Jehovah that you will not cut off my seed from me. Saul was asked him to at least keep a seed from his house. David swore. For these reasons, David was looking for that descendant to show his kindness. For Jonathan's sake. He asked, is there anyone there? I'm really touched here. On the one hand David said I want to show my kindness, but then he said I want to show the kindness of God. David was really one with God. Not even just his natural kindness. Zeeba, Saul's attendant, said there is still a son of Jonathan, he is crippled in his feet. The king said, Where is he? Zeeba, said he is somewhere in a place called Lodeba. David sent men to fetch Mephibosheth. He came. David, upon seeing, this young person. Maybe 25 years difference. The first thing David said, was Mephibosheth! He didn't use any other terms. He was so affectionate, so gentle, so personal. That sound is surely a safe sound, a sound of kindness. David said, Don't be afraid. I will surely show kindness to you for the sake of your father Jonathan and restore to you all Saul owned. You will eat food at my table continually. This person who would have been killed, is now invited to eat at David's table continually. This was repeated several times. Three times. Even he moved to Jerusalem just to be at the king's table every meal. Doesn't this remind you of the Lord' table? We don't belong there. We're not worthy, but the king saviour invited us. To eat and drink what He was prepared. As a feast for us. If you eat with the king even a snack will be big. If we have this feeling at the Lord's table. Mephibosheth told David I am just a dead dog. Yet we are here at His table. With peace, joy, love, security. Praise the Lord for the Lord's table. We are eating at the King's table. What kindness is this!

C - All the land - recover his inheritance in the good land.

D - That's us! Our life has been preserved. We didn't die. Our inheritance was been restored. That cup shows what had been lost has now been recovered. He's now our inheritance again.

## II. Mephibosheth had no ground to receive grace, yet he received it; the same is true with regard to us and God

You and I are descendants of Adam by birth. We have no ground, no position to receive grace. It is just given to us out of a heart of kindness.

### A. No position at all

He received kindness because of another person, his dad. We received kindness, not because of anything of us, but because of another person. Who is that other person? Our Jonathan is Jesus. Because of this one, today we are recovered back to the enjoyment of God. Because He died, we live. Because all the sins were upon Him that He bore to the tree, today we are blessed with eternal life. He tasted death for us so that we don't have to do that. We only taste life, the divine life. Thank You, Lord Jesus

### B. Lo-debar means a place without grass, without pasture

All sinners live in Lo-debar. A place with no grass, no pasture. A place dry, parched, waterless, desolate. A wasteland. That's the world. We are sinful, God's enemy and find yourself in this wasteland called the world. Even grass doesn't grow. The world has all this glittering attraction, it's all a big distraction. Not a blade of grass. And yet kindness awaits us to come to Jerusalem and have a seat at the table of the king. Let's flee this place forever and be with our king.

The reason he was crippled is because the nurse took him (after Saul and Jonathan died in battle) and hid themselves and while running he was dropped as a five year old and his legs were crippled.

### C. Not Mephibosheth sought David, David sought him

He was scared. Like Adam who knew he transgressed and hid himself. God came, Where are you? Wonderful footnote of that question

> immediately after the fall adam and eve knew the result of their transgression was death, therefore they hid themselves from the lord's presence waiting to be sentenced to death. However god came to seek them, not to give htem the sentence of death but to preach the gospel to them . the first question of the gospel to them was where are you?

I wish many young people would give this message, where are you? Don't hide from me. I'm not coming to kill you. I'm coming to tell you the way of salvation.

Mephibosheth never thought to come find David. It was David who was looking for him. None of us are looking for the Lord, really. It was God who sent men, gospel preachers, to fetch us, to find us.

### D. When David said, "Mephibosheth" a compassionate feeling

There was compassion in the utterance of that name. An affectionate feeling in his heart. Even the tone of his voice has something so pleasant. Something that expressed God's heart.

## III. Spiritually speaking, we all are like Mephibosheth, the grandson of Kind Saul, who was crippled in his feet

### A. feet remained lame

Nowadays we don't use the word lame. We say someone is "disabled", "incapacitated". To have both of your legs injured and not working is a very serious thing. The people of Israel that were brought to the saviour, many of them were cripples and lame, some were blind and paralysed. This condition of lameness is a sign you are impotent, unable to do anything good. Isn't this our story? We are permanently crippled, lame. When it comes to fulfilling the requirements of God, we cannot do it. I want to be good, I want to be nice, but what comes out is the opposite. That person at the pool for 38 years and he couldn't get into the pool. That picture is you do something to keep the law to be saved to be healed. Something he could never do. But Jesus came and saved him and healed him. Jesus heals. Jesus saves. It is Jesus who can deliver us.

### B. looked only at the riches not his feet

In front of table I don't see my feet. I see only what is on the table. Every day Mephibosheth was looking no longer at his lameness. All he saw were the riches on the table

### C. we can dine at the table even though we are still crippled

The way to be healed is to eat. The more we eat the kings food the more we will be saved and healed. We cannot even walk before God but thank Him they are now covered by the table. Hallelujah the table is over my feet. The table hides y feet. What I see is the unsearchably rich Christ as my food, my riches, my enjoyment.

We like to push away from the table every few minutes and look at our feet, paying attention to our feet, more than looking at the table, looking at Christ. After all these years I'm still lame. It's very discouraging. I had this experience the other day. I pushed back and looked at my feet. I got quite discouraged. The Lord came and said, what are you looking at? What are you gazing at? I'm not there under the table. Why don't you look at Me?

Brother and sisters, let us just confess our sins, lift up our eyes, look away unto Jesus. Every time we come to the Lord' table, look at Jesus. Let's look at Him! We see Jesus only.

The more you look at your feet, your feet won't get better. Why not just eat more and drink more. All the riches of the Triune God. All these riches are here for us to eat. To take in and enjoy. The more we eat the more we will really be healed.

### D. turn away from self introspection

We need the Lord's light, His shining. To  touch us, expose us, so that we can repent and confess our sins. That we need to do. But to look at your self. To do some kind of self diagnosis. That is dangerous. That can invite Satan's accusation. To spiral down into helplessness and despair. Even if the Lord is shining us, let us look at the light, at the Lord Himself.

### E. look at the riches

## IV. David's kindness to Mephibosheth signifies the kindness of God

### A. kindness is a benevolent goodness that issues out of the mercy and love of God

### B. the kindness and love of our Saviour God is what makes us different

Kindness reached us. Saved us. Made us different from others. But God, being rich in mercy, because of HIs great love with which He loved us. That He might display in the ages to come the surpassing riches of His kindness toward us. It is this that makes us different.

Mercy reaches farther than grace. You may say mercy is the carrier of grace, to bring God's love to us.

Out condition is a chasm that cannot be breached. Such a serious distance between God and the sinner. God's mercy breached this gap. It was all God that came this way. When the Word became flesh, He was full of grace. Even grace upon grace. That grace came to us according to God's mercy, and in God's kindness. Bringing us to the salvation.

Love is the source. Grace issues out of the love of God the Father. When the Lord came as grace, that was the declaration the revelation of the heart of love of God. Kindness is the attitude of God in giving us grace. Given with a certain kind of feeling. Something to do with God's inward parts. A heart of loving kindness. Even the OT it says again and again, God's loving kindness. Love and kindness put together in the same one word. Love with kindness. Kindness bears the love to us.

I am so touched and grateful. We are totally undeserving of God's love and the grace of Christ. But it has come. What can I say? 'Tis mercy all. The way it came to me, so gentle. So full of sympathy. So unjudgmental. Because God has judged His Son.

### C. In eternity God will make a display

Maybe we should make a banner with these four words - "God's grace in kindness".  God want to make a display to the whole universe. The king can do something for you but without any act of kindness, but think but to how David dealt with Mephibosheth, and think back to how God dealt with us. Carefully, personally, with kindness, with affection, with tenderness. Do you sense it? Feel it? Enjoy it? I do very much.

There's not one sinner that cannot be saved unless they would reject the gospel and not accept the gospel. No matter how far he or she has fallen. This is our good news to the sinner. No matter how far you have gone. How you feel you have been discarded and rejected by other people. God's salvation can and will reach you. In kindness.

### D. one item of the fruit of the spirit is kindness

Put on inward parts of kindness and compassion. We need to put on the new man and part of the new man are the "inward parts" of kindness and compassion. Let us fill ourselves not with hatred and judgment. Compassion and kindness toward one another. This is talking about the new man life.

Continue in the kindness of God. The kindness is a proof, a sign that Paul was a minister of God. The fruit of the spirit are all the characteristics, the virtues of Christ. To have the inward parts of compassion and kindness is to have the inward parts of Christ. The kindness we should have toward all man, toward one another.

One characteristic of love is love is kind. We are taught to be kind to one another. Kindness in today's society is a lost virtue. Where is kindness? There's no kindness. There's just harshness. Just hatred. There's no forgiveness. No long-suffering. All these things that have to do with kindness, it's hard to find today. Let us pursue love, which is kind. In caring for one another. For the Body of Christ.

I hope you are as inspired as I am that you have been moved by the kindness of God. I hope we would all live Christ and have His inward parts to show kindness toward one another.
