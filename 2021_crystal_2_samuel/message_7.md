# Message Seven - David typifying Christ, the real David - the King of the coming kingdom of God

Here we are talking about David being a type of Christ. The real David is Christ. David is a king and Christ is the real king. David's kingdom will also be Christ's kingdom and Christ's throne in reality.

Inwardly I had a prayer that although there is a lot of speaking in this message about the type and its fulfilment, in fact we are here touching the matter of the dispensation of the kingdom. Samuel turned the age from judgeship and priesthood to the age of the king. But Christ came to change the age from the age of the law to the age of grace. That is an even greater change of dispensation. After this age of grace there would be another dispensation before eternity, before the new heaven and new earth with the NJ. That is the coming age, the age of the kingdom. Here we're actually touching the dispensational change in God's full economy. David would have something to do with it. Christ has everything to do with it. It is a huge and massive subject here. But in order not to be distracted I will stick to this message.

Hard to find the appropriate hymns. Two hymns I selected, 147 on the praise of the Lord for His kingdom. We actually don't have many hymns praising the Lord for His kingdom. I find this is a hymn we hardly ever sing. Perhaps there would be the opportunity to pray, to give praise to God's anointed as the real David, the one who inherited the kingdom from God. The other hymn is 151, Come let us sing, praise to our king. Jesus is the true and real and permanent and eternal king. David is only a type.

## I. David typifies Christ, the real David

David typifies Christ, like none other.

### A. Most thorough type of Christ

Christ is so rich it takes so many types to reveal who and what He is. But of all the types in the OT, David is the most thorough. From the time David was anointed by Samuel, all the way to David's reign on the throne, covers the longest time. And covers so many aspects of the kingship.

As a boy David had to pass through many sufferings. He was made an assistant to King Saul. Under Saul David suffered a lot. David was rejected and was the one that fought. He was a warrior King, to fight down the enemies. In order to possess the land more fully, to establish the kingdom. He was the one who ascended to the throne. He was also the one who paid the full price to buy the land to build God's house. He was the one who prepared all the materials for the building of God's house. He was the one who prepared the blueprint of God's building. Can you see this is just Christ? Christ is the anointed One? At birth the magi came looking for the King. That baby in the manger was the king of the Jews. This King-Saviour suffered so much and was rejected and at the end was crucified and killed. It does not stop there. The gospel of Matthew refers to the King-Saviour, the One who is the King of the kingdom of the heavens. Eventually He entered into resurrection. Doing all this He was fighting the whole time, all the way to the cross. He conquered Satan and put him to shame as the waring King. In resurrection He prepared the material for the church and He is the One who builds the church. He ascended to the throne, to the right hand of God. Just is one the throne. Waiting for Satan to be fully defeated. The kingdoms of this world will become the kingdom of our Christ. Do you see that David was a full type of Christ the King. As I was considering this my spirit lept. I was just praising the Lord. Come let us sing, praise to our King!

### B. Christ is the greater David

The Lord going through the grain field on the Sabbath and His disciples began picking the grain of wheat. The Pharisees said they are doing something unlawful. This afforded the Lord the perfect opportunity to reveal who He was: the true David, the One greater than the temple, the Lord of the Sabbath.

How then does David, in spirit, call Him Lord? The Lord said to my Lord, sit until I put Your enemies beneath My feet. If then David calls Him Lord, how is He his son?

Before Samuel it was the priesthood arranged by God who would judge the people of Israel.

### C. type of the suffering Christ

Psalm 22, the Lord quoted on the cross.

> My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?

In this psalm the Lord's suffering is in great detail. I'm a little concerned the young people know about it but not the detailed knowledge. When you study it you will appreciate the Lord's dying on the cross for us.

> I will declare my name to your brothers, in the midst of the assembly I will sing hymns of praise to You

Psalm 109 is a prayer offering by David about his sufferings

David's psalm in his suffering foretells the Lord's suffering before He went to the cross.

This prayer (109) was answered in the next psalm (110). Unveils Christ in His ascension. God's answer to Christ's prayer was not only through resurrection but in ascension.
