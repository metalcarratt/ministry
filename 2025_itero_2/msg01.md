# Message One - The blessedness of being poor in spirit and pure in heart that we may be under Christ's heavenly ruling as our new King and that we may see God to express Him in His life and represent Him with His authority

Only those properly disciplined, trained, can be in the kingdom of the heavens, to execute God's judgment on the devil. The kingdom is a real exercise. No exercise, no kingdom. Matt. 5-7 is the kingdom constitution. We need to know this that this seed in us would not be hindered needlessly by us from growing.

Key words in the title:
- poor in spirit
- pure in heart
- heavenly ruling
- see God
- express Him
- represent Him

All of 5-7 depends on the condition of our spirit and the condition of our heart.

The conscience is the overlap between the spirit and the heart. Hence it is key. The condition of our heart determines how this economy can be carried out in us.

## I. "Blessed are the **poor in spirit**, for theirs is the **kingdom** of the heavens"--Matt. 5:3

- "poor in spirit" - empty and open
- "kingdom - lots of roomo for something of the Lord to come in.

### A. emptied, old things, unloaded

Lord, I am here again. Empty myself and receive something new.

At a certain time those used by God become full with even good things. Consider John the Baptist.

### C. humble, acknowledging we have nothing, know nothing, can do nothing, are nothing

### D. All spiritual progress depends on man's **hunger**

#### 1. Be afraid of **self-contentment**, ""self-satisfaction**, **satisfaction with the things of the past**

Forgetting the things that are behind, pressing on to the things that are before--Christ in deeper, further experience

#### 2. Spiritual **stagnation** is the result of **indifference** to one's own spiritual lack; **all failure and decadence are the result of self complacency**

Deut. 4:25
> When you have brought forth children and grandchildren and have **languished in the land**, and you have spoiled yourselves by making an idol, the form of anything, and have done that which is evil in the sight of Jehovah your God so as to anger Him;

- **languishing in the land** - loss of spiritual freshness, blunting of original impressions, produced by custom or long residence in the same spot.

#### b. Whenever we find ourselves crying, "I cannot make it", our progress has begun

#### c. We should remember that God gives difficulties to us in order to dig more deeply in us so that He can fill us more with Himself

#### 4. Whenever we become empty, the Lord will fill us up.

Open our mouth wide so He can fill it.

## II. "Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God"--Matt. 5:8

### A. a heart that is single, seeking nothing but the Lord

THe seed is okay, but how about the condition of the soil?

### C. Job saw God, gaining God, abhoring Himself

- to see God - no greater blessing in the universe
- abhoring - that's when you repent, when you confess, when you turn anew to God

### E. We **see** God so that we may be **constituted** with God; seeing God **transforms** us, equals **gaining** God, to **become** God in life and in nature

## III. We should aspire to have an enlarged heart--Psa. 119:32

To envelope and embrace the saints. To not be self content but concerned for people.

## IV. Maintain the newness of heart and spirit

### H. Our (1) loving the Lord and our (2) exercising our spirit in prayer and in (3) reading the Word day by day change and renw our mind

## V. when our heart fully possessed God will have a way
