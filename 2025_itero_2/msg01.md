# Message One - The blessedness of being poor in spirit and pure in heart that we may be under Christ's heavenly ruling as our new King and that we may see God to express Him in His life and represent Him with His authority

Only those properly disciplined, trained, can be in the kingdom of the heavens, to execute God's judgment on the devil. The kingdom is a real exercise. No exercise, no kingdom. Matt. 5-7 is the kingdom constitution. We need to know this that this seed in us would not be hindered needlessly by us from growing.

Key words in the title:
- poor in spirit
- pure in heart
- heavenly ruling
- see God
- express Him
- represent Him

All of 5-7 depends on the condition of our spirit and the condition of our heart.

The conscience is the overlap between the spirit and the heart. Hence it is key. The condition of our heart determines how this economy can be carried out in us.

- "kingdom - lots of roomo for something of the Lord to come in.

### A. emptied, old things, unloaded

Lord, I am here again. Empty myself and receive something new.

At a certain time those used by God become full with even good things. Consider John the Baptist.

### C. humble, acknowledging we have nothing, know nothing, can do nothing, are nothing

### D. All spiritual progress depends on man's **hunger**

#### 1. Be afraid of **self-contentment**, ""self-satisfaction**, **satisfaction with the things of the past**

Forgetting the things that are behind, pressing on to the things that are before--Christ in deeper, further experience
