# Message Eight - Reigning in Life

Book - vital group ch 17. Ten key points we've been covered so far. The last point is reigning in life. Additional paragraph at the end. Need to be conscious of a certain reality

> we stil need to pray much for the LR. we should not consider the lord will do something easy or light when he is facing his enemy. his enemy is still on the earth walkking about as a roaring lion. No one around to stop him. need to be faithful to be one with god to deal with his enemy.

The word reigning implies a certain kind of warfare. To reign we need to overcome obstacles to our reigning. Gen. 1. God created man in his own image, caused man to have dominion. v 28, 'subdue'. God wants man to subdue the earth. The footnote indicates there is a warfare raging in the universe between God and Satan. The Lord is looking to man to do this subduing function. 

We may think reigning in life is something beyond us, for a few. May be intimidated. Looking forward to message 10. We have a right to experience the things of the Lord. Inheritance. Acts 26:18, the Lord commissioned Paul in a particular way. On the way to Damascus the Lord shines and speaks to him. A commission. To open their eyes, to turn them from darkness to light and from the authority of Satan to God that thye may receive forgiveness of sin, and an inheritance among those who have been sanctificed by faith in me. Forgiveness and inheritance. This matter of reigning in life is part of our inheritance. As sons of God, we are entitled to experience the reigning in life. 

This is not an optional thing. Lord, by your mercy and grace enable me to reign in life over every negative thing. This enables us to enter into the genuine church life.

Kingship. Reigning implies a kind of kingship. It's the kings that reign. It's a monarchy. Part of our inheritance as believers is that we can enter into a certain kind of kingdhip. Every NT believer is to be a king and a priest. The life we have received does not merely save us from a few things - it enthrones us as kings to reign over all things. This is part of our inheritance. This is an experience for all of us.

These twelve messages are a treasure. To get into, to pray over, that these things would become our experience. Just get into the word, pray over the word, and fellowship. May the words of this training become our fellowship, our communication, the things we talk about. May we be those who handle these words for the remainder of our days.

The enemy would like to prevent us, frustrate us. Let's point the liar in the corner. Let us not allow him.

By living under the rule of the divine life we can live the church life. We may think we are already living the church life. But we need to ask, is our living of the church life the living of the divine life or something natural? There is no possibility for us to live the church life if we are not under the ruling of the divine life. This may defy our concept, but it is the fact. If we want to have a genuine churh life we need the ruling of the divine life. A church life that is *genuine*, that is *according to God*, that is for the *preparation of the bride*. Need for all the believers to practice the limitation in the divine life. Open our inner being to the Lord for His speaking.

## I. God's complete salvation is for us to reign in life by the abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness

Rom. 5:17. For if, by the offence of the one, death reigned through the one, much more, those who receive the abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness will reign in life through the one, Jesus Christ.

**the offence of the one** - Adam. Death reigned. Death was the king. Do you like that kind? 

There is another king. A certain king identified here. Death on the one hand, reigning in life on the other. Another king. Put your name there. Insert your name. Much more those. Who are those? It's use. Who receive the abundance of grace. Those will reign in life. Because we are those who receive the abundance of grace and the gift of righteousness.

**grace**. what we need to receive. don't you want to be among those doing the receiving? His complete salvation is for us to reign in life. There is a grace shortage in the world today. As a result death reigns. Consider the world situation with no grace. Sin and death are reigning. 

[A] reigning in life - full experience of organic salvation. The Lord is opening His word and showing us this process. A much more salvation. Micah 5:2, the goings forth of the Lord. Continuous. This is the way life operates. A continuous spreading matter. Life is always spreading. Vibrant, active. His life in us is the seed of life growing and spreading within us. Now we come to another step. A part of the process. A process we have all been put into. Do not take the lie that somehow you are not in the process. We are in the process of God growing in us. 

[B] grace for organic salvation. Grace is needed for us to reign in life. We need to receive the grace. There is no problem on the supply of grace. Grace is God Himself coming to us. The shortage is on the side of receiving. May we learn to be the best receivers. He wants to give us the grace. The issue is really on our receiving. May we pray, Lord, make me the best receiver. Not to try to be a better brother or sister. Help me to receive this grace.

All sufficient. Can meet every need. Noah. Gen 6. Aren't we in the days of Noah? As it was in the days of Noah, so will it be in the coming of the son of man. Jehovah had regretted he had made man, because of the violence, the immorality, the corruption. How could Noah live in the midst of that corruption? It said that Noah walked with God. How is that possible? Because he found grace. The grace was there. It enabled him to be faithful to the Lord's command. 

God rescued righteous Lot who had been oppressed by the life of the lawless.  Those who violate the law of nature and conscience. Lot was in Sodom and Gomorrah. He's a righteous man. But he's oppressed by the licentious manner of life of the lawless. A particular, unprincipled life of the lawless. Violating the law of nature. This is the environment we live in today. It's easy for us to be oppressed, depressed, frustrated. We need to learn of Noah to find grace in the eyes of the Lord. In the midst of such a dark environment. Matt. 24, lawlessness will be multiplied and the love of many will grow cold. This kind of atmosphere can have an affect on us. We have loved ones. We may suffer because of the things around us.

W. Nee

> what does it mean to wear someone else? To exhaust a person minute by minute, some today, some tomorrow. invisibly, inpercetibly. Satan works in God's children by the principle of wearing them out. We may think it is insignificant but the result of this wearing out is total depletion. It would be wonderful if God's children would become angry with Satan and rebuke him. Some people are very weak. They allow Satan to wear them out. God's children should become angry with Satan. Once they become angry and disgusted, everything will be settled.

This little serpent is there, engaged in trying to wear the saints out. How he would love to wear us out, discourage us. I hope we all would be encouraged, vitalised. This is the matter of grace. This is what we need in this dark age.

[C] highest attainment of pursuing Christ. Be subject to God and withstand the devil and he will flee from you. To be subject to God is to withstand the devil. It always causes him to flee from us. We bring ourselves into submission to the Lord. Honour him, give ourselves to him. Pray which indicates we are not but he is. We need him. We humble ourselves. This is what enables us to withstand the devil.

Acts 28:21-29. On the ship. Paul was a prisoner. Get into the LS of this portion. Paul's really not the prisoner. He's the king. He lives a life of ascendancy. 276 souls on the ship were subjects under the kingdom of Paul. During his long voyage God enabled Paul to live a life far above human anxiety. This was Jesus living again on the earth in His divinely enriched humanity. No wonder people honoured them. To reign in life is to subdue all these negative factors.

Reigning in life is not the be the king in our household. Who is the king? This matter doesn't entitle us to anything. In order to reign in life, we need to practice the restriction and limitation in the divine life. Matt. 8, the centurion has a valuable servant who is very ill and he wants the Lord to come and heal, but he says, I also am a man set under authority. He recognised the Lord was a man under authority. The Lord could do nothing out of Himself. He was there always taking care of the Father's will, speaking the words the Father gave Him. The Lord was one who accepted the imitation of divine authority. He Himself subjected Himself to the divine authority. The centurion recognised this. "I also am a man under authority."

## II. We need to enter into the experience of reigning in life

This is our destiny, but not just for the future. It is for today.

[A] regenerated with divine, heavenly, kingly, royal life. What a life we have. Being a believer is not a low thing. What an inheritance we have. 

[B] We enter by coming under the ruling of the divine life. Joseph. The reigning aspect of the matured life. Jacob goes through series of experiences of being broken. The reigning aspect is seen in Joseph. I always marvelled at Joseph. He could be so mistreated but at the end said, you meant it for evil but God meant it for good. During the time of famine, he was the authority. Even with the mistreatment from his brothers he understood the Lord wanted to accomplish something more.

This is how the power of darkness will be pushed back. The only way the enemy could be subdued. 

[C] subdue all kinds of insubordination. It describes our condition. We also face circumstances, persons, situations, things. Something rebelling against life and against God. Numbers 16. A kind of rebellion instigated by Korah. Moses fell on his face which indicates he just went to the Lord rather than just trying to deal with the situation. He went to the Lord. As a result, Jehovah had ground to come in and deal with the rebellion. A lesson for us - we wouldn't take matters into our own hands but go to the Lord.

## III. Reigning in life in Romans 5 is the key to everything in Romans 6-16

Romans 5, reigning in life. What else is in the book of Romans, Body life, receiving the believers, fellowship. For us to enter into the genuine church life and the real practice of the body of life. We need to enter into the experience of Romans 5.

You may say I'm not reigning in life but we have a church life. I think we have tasted something of reigning in life to some degree. But it's a much more salvation. We need to enter into it much more. This matter of maturity doesn't have to take years and years. The maturing process can go much faster. To take the words and receive them. The allow the words to penetrate your being. If these words have impact, don't you think the Lord can bring us into the reality of these things. The reigning in life will issue from our digesting this kind of ministry. 

[A] see everything in this life

## IV. The issue of our reigning in life, under the ruling of the divine life, is the real and practical Body life expressed in the church life.

If we live with each other in a natural way, how can the Lord attain the reality of the Body?

[A] each item in Rom 12-13 requires us to be ruled by the divine life:

1. present our body as a living sacrifice
2. not be fashioned according to this age, transformed by renewing of the mind
3. not thing more highly of ourselves than we ought to think. the mind that is in Christ. The Lord lowers Himself in such a way. His humiliation involves seven steps. this pattern is what we need. Tear down the high opinion we have of ourselves. Phil 2, a Person with a different kind of mind. An experience where I saw a brother displaying this mind of Christ. A brother I knew had done something that was quite bad. It was a serious mistake. Several of us knew it and realised it needed to be dealt with in some way. Myself and the brother were joined by a third brother. The brother took out his wallet and brought out a $100 bill and said I think this is a special occasion. I thought this was going to be a time for rebuke or correction. But $100 comes out. So we proceeded to have dinner together. What I saw in the brother was the mind of Christ in Philippians 2. One, the "violator" and the brother trying to shepherd him. but the shepherding was according to God. he just lowered himself. many times we deal with the saints, we're going to set each other straight. what I saw was a lowering of himself. Later on the "violator" told me if it wasn't for that fellowship he wasn't going to come back to the church life. there was some enlightening, but it was done in such a way. Who are we to judge one another concerning so many things. Someone who just lowers himself in such a tender way to just minister to the brother. Something we really need to apply. You need grace to be unloaded from your pride, our ambition, your poor attitude toward a brother or sister
4. many members, not having the same function

[B] highest virtues:

1. love one another warmly. br. Lee said we need to be more affectionate in the church life. We have too many stone faces. We don't need to be stone faced in the church life. Greet one another in a warm way. Not just as we walk out the door. Continue in a day by day house by house church life. Involved with one another. 
2. not slothful in zeal, burning in spirit
3. enduring in tribulation
4. rejoice with those rejoicing, weep with those who weep. Rejoice with the rejoicing one. Weep with the weeping one. If the brother is weeping we can't take the attitude, you're on your own. join with one another.  What happens to X, matter to me. Learn to empathise with one another. What happens to the brothers and sisters matters to us. We should be concerned about how the saints are doing all over the earth
5. live in peace with all men (as possible)

## V. We need to reign in life in imitating the apostle Paul to bring the local churches into the fellowship of the Body of Christ

Fellowship used 8 times. One of the great things we have in the church life is fellowship. We should treasure fellowship. I met the Lord in a strange situation but it was dynamic. But I didn't know any Christians. I didn't have any fellowship. I tried to be a good Christian, told my friends to stop doing what they were doing. I lasted about two months. About a year later I was introduced to fellowship. We should treasure fellowship. Fellowship is a joint participation. We enter into an enterprise, an activity together in a joint way. We participate. We are not an on-looker. You enter in. You participate. In light of this training, we should fellowship over these matters.

There is nearly no living of the Body life due to the lack of the reigning in life. I believe the fellowship will afford us the way to enter into the practical experience of all these points.

[A] no organisation in the Body, just fellowship. Open to open another, open to the Lord, in a genuine way, not in the way of pretence or obligation. To know the Lord's mind.

[B] fellowship of the Body of Christ. Fellowship saves us from individuality. Shortly after I got saved a brother asked me out for coffee and said lets have fellowship. I said what do you mean? He said we can open up to one another. He asked me how are you? But I would say, not just to open up concerning our human situation, but to enter into the meaning of these words in this training. Let's fellowship. Let's enter into the words together. We're all sheep and we're all shepherds.

[C] by fellowship God will crush Satan under our feet.

## VI. Romans 16 gives us an excellent pattern of the apostle Paul in bringing all the saints into the blending life of the entire Body of Christ; it is in such a life that we can truly reign in life

13 verses begin with the word 'greet.' We need to greet one another. What feeling Paul is expressing here. The attitude Paul displays indicates such love and concern for the saints

[A] one by one. considerable amount of knowledge, understanding, care with regard to each one. This is the reigning life on display. This is the test. If we are really those who enter into the reigning life we will enter into what Paul is displaying here.

*A Word of Love*. This is the word of love I'm burdened to pass on to you all. Ambition, pride, self justification, not being conformed to the death of Christ are four gophers. These four negative factors still remain among us. This will annul what we benefit we receive from the high peak truths. I have a burden from the Lord to write a further crystallisation study of Romans. A number of messages on reigning in life. However I am concerned if these four gophers are not dealt with the more truths released the more pride we will have. The enemy lurks. We need to be conscious of this. Not allow the enemy to come in to frustrate what the Lord wants to do.

2 Cor. 13:14. The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, the love of God, the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all.
