During his school days Watchman Nee's seeking after the Lord brought him into frequent contact with Margaret E. Barber. Miss Barber, an Anglican missionary, was sent to Fukien, China, in the latter part  of the last century. Her co-missionaries became jealous of her and  fabricated a serious charge which caused her to be recalled from the  field. Miss Barber had  come to know the Lord in a living way. She had deeply experienced the  cross and practiced continually the lessons of the cross. For this  reason, she decided not to vindicate herself concerning the charges made against her. She remained at home in Great Britain for a number of  years. At a certain point, the chairman of the mission board became  aware that the case against her was misrepresented, and he asked her to  tell him the truth. He said he realized that she was seeking to learn  the lesson of the cross and that she would say nothing in her own  defense, but as one in authority over her, he commanded her to tell the  truth. Miss Barber then  told the whole story. She was fully vindicated before the mission board, and the decision was made to send her back to China. However, she  resigned from the mission, considering that it was the right time to do  so, even though she still had the burden to return to China for the  Lord's interest. (*Watchman Nee—A Seer of the Divine Revelation in the Present Age,* Chapter 3, Section 2)

Before this time Miss Barber had come in contact with D.M. Panton. Mr. Panton was both a great  student of the Word and one who had learned the evils of  denominationalism. Through her relationship with him, Miss Barber also became clear concerning the denominations. (*Watchman Nee—A Seer of the Divine Revelation in the Present Age,* Chapter 3, Section 2)

After spending much time in prayer, she felt the Lord Himself was sending her back to China. She did return to China, but this time not in connection with any mission. From a human standpoint, she went back on her own in  the early part of this century. She settled in a suburb of Foochow,  Watchman Nee's home city. She lived there with little traveling and no  publicity. She simply remained at home, praying much for the Lord's move in China and helping those who sought her counsel in seeking after the  Lord. She was, no doubt, a seed sown in China by the Lord for His  recovery. She composed a number of poems, many of which have been  adapted for inclusion in our hymnbook (Hymns, published by Living Stream Ministry). All of them exhibit a deep experience in Christ. (*Watchman Nee—A Seer of the Divine Revelation in the Present Age,* Chapter 3, Section 2)

Margaret Barber lived by faith. She had no outward means of support. According to  Chinese custom, all bills must be fully paid at the end of the year. But at the end of one year, she discovered she was short one hundred twenty Chinese dollars. With only two days remaining until the Chinese new  year, she prayed desperately to the Lord for this need. On the last day  of the year, a cable arrived from D.M. Panton in London through the  British bank in Foochow. The amount sent was exactly one hundred twenty  Chinese dollars. (*Watchman Nee—A Seer of the Divine Revelation in the Present Age,* Chapter 3, Section 2)

Through his relationship with Miss Barber, Watchman Nee was greatly edified and perfected. Whenever he had a  problem or needed spiritual instruction or strengthening, he would go to her. She treated him as a young learner and frequently administered  strict discipline. (*Watchman Nee—A Seer of the Divine Revelation in the Present Age,* Chapter 3, Section 2)

At that time over sixty young brothers and sisters received help from Miss Barber. Being deep in the Lord and exceedingly strict, she frequently rebuked  the young people concerning many things. After a short time most of  these young people stopped going to her. The only one who continued to  see her was Watchman Nee. When he visited her, she rebuked and reproved  him. Frequently she pointed out that as a young man he could not serve  the Lord in this way or that way. However, the more she rebuked him, the more he returned to be rebuked. By deliberately putting himself before  her to be rebuked, he received untold help. (*Watchman Nee—A Seer of the Divine Revelation in the Present Age,* Chapter 3, Section 2)







There were sixty-six young people under Sister Barber's training. In the first letter I received from Brother D.M. Panton, he  said that it would be considered good if after ten years six of those  young people would still remain. Now, after a long period of time, only  four remain. (*Watchman Nee—A Seer of the Divine Revelation in the Present Age,* Chapter 3, Section 3)

Margaret Barber was very  much in the Lord's presence. One day Watchman Nee went to see her. While he was temporarily delayed in being received by her, he waited in her  living room. He said that even though she was not yet there, he had a  deep sense of the Lord's presence. (*Watchman Nee—A Seer of the Divine Revelation in the Present Age,* Chapter 3, Section 3)

Margaret Barber went to be with the Lord in 1930. In her will she left all her belongings to  Watchman Nee. These included little more than her old Bible with all the precious notes. Though he intended to write her biography, time did not allow. (*Watchman Nee—A Seer of the Divine Revelation in the Present Age,* Chapter 3, Section 3)

We feel most sorrowful concerning the news of the passing away of Miss Barber in Lo-Hsing Pagoda, Fukien. She was one who was very deep in the Lord,  and in my opinion, the kind of fellowship she had with the Lord and the  kind of faithfulness she expressed to the Lord are rarely found on this  earth. (*Watchman Nee—A Seer of the Divine Revelation in the Present Age,* Chapter 3, Section 3)

Miss Barber always put  Watchman Nee under Leland Wang (Wang Tsai), one of his co-workers.  Leland was five years his senior and was continually disagreeing with  Watchman's concept. This caused Watchman a great deal of suffering. When appealing to Miss Barber  for the solution to their problems, she would continually put him down,  saying that Leland was older than he. On one occasion a baptism was  scheduled. Who should be the baptizer became a problem to them. Watchman referred the matter to Miss Barber. Her answer was that Leland should be the baptizer. When Watchman asked  why, she answered, "Because he is older than you." Dan-wu, another  brother with them, was older than Leland Wang. Watchman thought he could defeat Leland Wang by bringing up Dan-wu and suggested to Miss Barber, "Since Brother Wu is older than Brother Leland, he should be the  baptizer." However, she still answered that Leland should be the  baptizer. She would not yield him any ground so that he might learn the  lesson of the cross and learn not to reason but to submit. (*Watchman Nee—A Seer of the Divine Revelation in the Present Age,* Chapter 3, Section 3)




In 1923 seven of us worked together as co-workers. Two of us took the lead, a co-worker who was five years my senior and myself. We had a co-workers' meeting every Friday in which the other five were often forced to listen to the arguing between the leading two. We were all young then, and each had his own way of thinking. I often charged the elder co-worker with being wrong, and vice versa. Since my temperament had not been dealt with, I frequently lost my temper. Today in 1936 I do sometimes laugh, but I seldom laughed at that time. In our controversies I admit that many times I was wrong, but he was also at times in the wrong. It was easy for me to forgive my own faults, but not easy to forgive others. After having a dispute on Friday, I would go to Sister Barber on Saturday and accuse the other co-worker. I would say, "I told that co-worker that he should act in a certain way, but he would not listen. You should speak to him." Sister Barber replied, "He is five years older than you; you should listen to him and obey him." I answered, "Am I to listen to him whether he is reasonable or not?" She said, "Yes! The Scriptures say that the younger should obey the elder." I replied, "I cannot possibly do this. A Christian should act according to reason." She answered, "Whether there is reason or not, you need not care. The Scriptures say that the younger should obey the elder." I was angry at heart that the Bible would say such a thing. I wanted to give vent to my indignation, but I could not.

Each time following the controversy on Friday, I would go to her to state my grievances, but she would again quote the Scriptures, demanding that I obey the elder. Sometimes I wept Friday evening after the dispute on Friday afternoon. Then I would go to Sister Barber the next day to state my grievances, hoping that she would vindicate me. But I would weep again after coming home Saturday evening. I wished I had been born a few years earlier. In one controversy I had very good arguments. I felt that when I pointed them out, she would see how my co-worker was wrong and would support me. But she said, "Whether that co-worker is wrong or not is another matter. While you are accusing your brother before me, are you like one who is bearing the cross? Are you like a lamb?" When she questioned me in this way, I felt very ashamed and I could never forget it. My speech and my attitude that day revealed that I was indeed not like one bearing the cross, nor like a lamb.  (Watchman Nee—A Seer of the Divine Revelation in the Present Age, Chapter 3, Section 4)




On the morning of March 28, 1921, my mother asked, "If I were to be baptized by immersion, how would you feel?" I replied, "That is just what I have been waiting for." She asked, "Where can we go to be baptized by immersion?" I answered, "I inquired about it quite some time ago. We can go to Mawei (which is two hours away from Foochow by small steamer) and find out from Miss Barber. When Dora Yu came to Fukien, she was baptized by immersion at Miss Barber's place." We felt that rather than choose a date, it was better to do it that same day. So my mother and I decided to depart that very same day. Upon arriving at Miss Barber's, we told her of our intention and she fully agreed. Thus, on the same day we went hurriedly to the countryside of Yangchi and were immersed there. (Watchman Nee—A Seer of the Divine Revelation in the Present Age, Chapter 6, Section 1)



In order to keep his fellowship with the Lord untarnished, Watchman Nee learned how to apply the blood of Christ to his situation. He told me that once his conscience was strongly condemning him before God concerning certain things. He could not get through, so he was compelled to seek out Miss Barber for help. After relating his story to her, she said to him, "The blood of Jesus His Son cleanses us" (1 John 1:7). When he told her that he was still under condemnation she repeated to him several times, "The blood of Jesus His Son cleanses us." Eventually, he received light that only the blood of the Lord can keep one's conscience from any kind of condemnation before God. By that fellowship with Miss Barber, he learned that through the cleansing of the Lord's blood it is possible to keep oneself always in the presence of God. (Watchman Nee—A Seer of the Divine Revelation in the Present Age, Chapter 8, Section 3)





Margaret Barber was a  great example to Watchman Nee in the one matter of paying more attention to life than to work. He realized that God cares for what we are more  than what we do, and his work was according to this principle. He  observed how Miss Barber continually stressed the matter of life, paying almost no attention to her work.

From time to time, he and Miss Barber would go together to listen to a Christian speaker. He always admired  either the speaker's eloquence, knowledge, zeal, ability, or natural  power of persuasion. Then Miss Barber would point out to him that what he admired was neither of life nor of  the Spirit. What he admired might be able to stir people up and motivate them to perform certain works, but it could never minister life to  people. Through such spiritual diagnosis, he was educated to discern and distinguish the difference between life and work. He began to realize  that most of the sermons given by preachers and Christian teachers were  not grains of life but flakes of chaff. He also observed that in most  Christian work, supposedly carried out for Christ, there is very little  life ministered to people. (*Watchman Nee—A Seer of the Divine Revelation in the Present Age,* Chapter 11, Section 1)



He told me that when his co-worker, who was five years older than he,  was traveling through the country conducting evangelistic meetings,  Margaret Barber, realizing the peril of popularity, warned him by saying, "If you continue to  travel for evangelistic work, I will not pray for you any longer." She  had the foresight to realize that such work would bring shipwreck to his spiritual life. Eventually, that is exactly what happened. That other  co-worker was distracted from spiritual life to popular work. (*Watchman Nee—A Seer of the Divine Revelation in the Present Age,* Chapter 11, Section 1)
