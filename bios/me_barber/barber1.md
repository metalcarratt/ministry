**During his school days** Watchman Nee's seeking after the Lord brought him into frequent contact with Margaret E. Barber. Miss Barber, an Anglican missionary, was sent to Fukien, China, in the latter part  of the last century. Her co-missionaries became jealous of her and  fabricated a serious charge which caused her to be recalled from the  field. Miss Barber had  come to know the Lord in a living way. She had deeply experienced the  cross and practiced continually the lessons of the cross. For this  reason, she decided not to vindicate herself concerning the charges made against her. She remained at home in Great Britain for a number of  years. At a certain point, the chairman of the mission board became  aware that the case against her was misrepresented, and he asked her to  tell him the truth. He said he realized that she was seeking to learn  the lesson of the cross and that she would say nothing in her own  defense, but as one in authority over her, he commanded her to tell the  truth. Miss Barber then  told the whole story. She was fully vindicated before the mission board, and the decision was made to send her back to China. However, she  resigned from the mission, considering that it was the right time to do  so, even though she still had the burden to return to China for the  Lord's interest. (*Watchman Nee—A Seer of the Divine Revelation in the Present Age,* Chapter 3, Section 2)

**Before this time** Miss Barber had come in contact with D.M. Panton. Mr. Panton was both a great  student of the Word and one who had learned the evils of  denominationalism. Through her relationship with him, Miss Barber also became clear concerning the denominations. (*Watchman Nee—A Seer of the Divine Revelation in the Present Age,* Chapter 3, Section 2)

After spending much time in prayer, she felt the Lord Himself was **sending her back to China**. She did return to China, but this time not in connection with any mission. From a human standpoint, she went back on her own in  the early part of this century. She settled in a suburb of Foochow,  Watchman Nee's home city. She lived there with little traveling and no  publicity. She simply remained at home, praying much for the Lord's move in China and helping those who sought her counsel in seeking after the  Lord. She was, no doubt, a seed sown in China by the Lord for His  recovery. She composed a number of poems, many of which have been  adapted for inclusion in our hymnbook (Hymns, published by Living Stream Ministry). All of them exhibit a deep experience in Christ. (*Watchman Nee—A Seer of the Divine Revelation in the Present Age,* Chapter 3, Section 2)

Margaret Barber lived by faith. She had no outward means of support. According to  Chinese custom, all bills must be fully paid at the end of the year. But at the end of one year, she discovered she was short one hundred twenty Chinese dollars. With only two days remaining until the Chinese new  year, she prayed desperately to the Lord for this need. On the last day  of the year, a cable arrived from D.M. Panton in London through the  British bank in Foochow. The amount sent was exactly one hundred twenty  Chinese dollars. (*Watchman Nee—A Seer of the Divine Revelation in the Present Age,* Chapter 3, Section 2)

Through his relationship with Miss Barber, Watchman Nee was greatly edified and perfected. Whenever he had a  problem or needed spiritual instruction or strengthening, he would go to her. She treated him as a young learner and frequently administered  strict discipline. (*Watchman Nee—A Seer of the Divine Revelation in the Present Age,* Chapter 3, Section 2)

#### 7
**At that time** over sixty young brothers and sisters received help from Miss Barber. Being deep in the Lord and exceedingly strict, she frequently rebuked  the young people concerning many things. After a short time most of  these young people stopped going to her. The only one who continued to  see her was Watchman Nee. When he visited her, she rebuked and reproved  him. Frequently she pointed out that as a young man he could not serve  the Lord in this way or that way. However, the more she rebuked him, the more he returned to be rebuked. By deliberately putting himself before  her to be rebuked, he received untold help. (*Watchman Nee—A Seer of the Divine Revelation in the Present Age,* Chapter 3, Section 2)

#### 8
There were sixty-six young people under Sister Barber's training. In the first letter I received from Brother D.M. Panton, he  said that it would be considered good if after ten years six of those  young people would still remain. Now, after a long period of time, only  four remain. (*Watchman Nee—A Seer of the Divine Revelation in the Present Age,* Chapter 3, Section 3)

Margaret Barber was very  much in the Lord's presence. One day Watchman Nee went to see her. While he was temporarily delayed in being received by her, he waited in her  living room. He said that even though she was not yet there, he had a  deep sense of the Lord's presence. (*Watchman Nee—A Seer of the Divine Revelation in the Present Age,* Chapter 3, Section 3)

Margaret Barber went to be with the Lord in 1930. In her will she left all her belongings to  Watchman Nee. These included little more than her old Bible with all the precious notes. Though he intended to write her biography, time did not allow. (*Watchman Nee—A Seer of the Divine Revelation in the Present Age,* Chapter 3, Section 3)

#### 12
We feel most sorrowful concerning the news of the passing away of Miss Barber in Lo-Hsing Pagoda, Fukien. She was one who was very deep in the Lord,  and in my opinion, the kind of fellowship she had with the Lord and the  kind of faithfulness she expressed to the Lord are rarely found on this  earth. (*Watchman Nee—A Seer of the Divine Revelation in the Present Age,* Chapter 3, Section 3)

#### 13
Miss Barber always put  Watchman Nee under Leland Wang (Wang Tsai), one of his co-workers.  Leland was five years his senior and was continually disagreeing with  Watchman's concept. This caused Watchman a great deal of suffering. When appealing to Miss Barber  for the solution to their problems, she would continually put him down,  saying that Leland was older than he. On one occasion a baptism was  scheduled. Who should be the baptizer became a problem to them. Watchman referred the matter to Miss Barber. Her answer was that Leland should be the baptizer. When Watchman asked  why, she answered, "Because he is older than you." Dan-wu, another  brother with them, was older than Leland Wang. Watchman thought he could defeat Leland Wang by bringing up Dan-wu and suggested to Miss Barber, "Since Brother Wu is older than Brother Leland, he should be the  baptizer." However, she still answered that Leland should be the  baptizer. She would not yield him any ground so that he might learn the  lesson of the cross and learn not to reason but to submit. (*Watchman Nee—A Seer of the Divine Revelation in the Present Age,* Chapter 3, Section 3)

In 1923 seven of us worked together as co-workers. Two of us took the lead, a co-worker who was five years my senior and myself. We had a co-workers' meeting every Friday in which the other five were often forced to listen to the arguing between the leading two. We were all young then, and each had his own way of thinking. I often charged the elder co-worker with being wrong, and vice versa. Since my temperament had not been dealt with, I frequently lost my temper. Today in 1936 I do sometimes laugh, but I seldom laughed at that time. In our controversies I admit that many times I was wrong, but he was also at times in the wrong. It was easy for me to forgive my own faults, but not easy to forgive others. After having a dispute on Friday, I would go to Sister Barber on Saturday and accuse the other co-worker. I would say, "I told that co-worker that he should act in a certain way, but he would not listen. You should speak to him." Sister Barber replied, "He is five years older than you; you should listen to him and obey him." I answered, "Am I to listen to him whether he is reasonable or not?" She said, "Yes! The Scriptures say that the younger should obey the elder." I replied, "I cannot possibly do this. A Christian should act according to reason." She answered, "Whether there is reason or not, you need not care. The Scriptures say that the younger should obey the elder." I was angry at heart that the Bible would say such a thing. I wanted to give vent to my indignation, but I could not.

Each time following the controversy on Friday, I would go to her to state my grievances, but she would again quote the Scriptures, demanding that I obey the elder. Sometimes I wept Friday evening after the dispute on Friday afternoon. Then I would go to Sister Barber the next day to state my grievances, hoping that she would vindicate me. But I would weep again after coming home Saturday evening. I wished I had been born a few years earlier. In one controversy I had very good arguments. I felt that when I pointed them out, she would see how my co-worker was wrong and would support me. But she said, "Whether that co-worker is wrong or not is another matter. While you are accusing your brother before me, are you like one who is bearing the cross? Are you like a lamb?" When she questioned me in this way, I felt very ashamed and I could never forget it. My speech and my attitude that day revealed that I was indeed not like one bearing the cross, nor like a lamb.  (Watchman Nee—A Seer of the Divine Revelation in the Present Age, Chapter 3, Section 4)

On the morning of March 28, 1921, my mother asked, "If I were to be baptized by immersion, how would you feel?" I replied, "That is just what I have been waiting for." She asked, "Where can we go to be baptized by immersion?" I answered, "I inquired about it quite some time ago. We can go to Mawei (which is two hours away from Foochow by small steamer) and find out from Miss Barber. When Dora Yu came to Fukien, she was baptized by immersion at Miss Barber's place." We felt that rather than choose a date, it was better to do it that same day. So my mother and I decided to depart that very same day. Upon arriving at Miss Barber's, we told her of our intention and she fully agreed. Thus, on the same day we went hurriedly to the countryside of Yangchi and were immersed there.

In order to keep his fellowship with the Lord untarnished, Watchman Nee learned how to apply the blood of Christ to his situation. He told me that once his conscience was strongly condemning him before God concerning certain things. He could not get through, so he was compelled to seek out Miss Barber for help. After relating his story to her, she said to him, "The blood of Jesus His Son cleanses us" (1 John 1:7). When he told her that he was still under condemnation she repeated to him several times, "The blood of Jesus His Son cleanses us." Eventually, he received light that only the blood of the Lord can keep one's conscience from any kind of condemnation before God. By that fellowship with Miss Barber, he learned that through the cleansing of the Lord's blood it is possible to keep oneself always in the presence of God. (Watchman Nee—A Seer of the Divine Revelation in the Present Age, Chapter 8, Section 3)

Margaret Barber was a  great example to Watchman Nee in the one matter of paying more attention to life than to work. He realized that God cares for what we are more  than what we do, and his work was according to this principle. He  observed how Miss Barber continually stressed the matter of life, paying almost no attention to her work.

From time to time, he and Miss Barber would go together to listen to a Christian speaker. He always admired  either the speaker's eloquence, knowledge, zeal, ability, or natural  power of persuasion. Then Miss Barber would point out to him that what he admired was neither of life nor of  the Spirit. What he admired might be able to stir people up and motivate them to perform certain works, but it could never minister life to  people. Through such spiritual diagnosis, he was educated to discern and distinguish the difference between life and work. He began to realize  that most of the sermons given by preachers and Christian teachers were  not grains of life but flakes of chaff. He also observed that in most  Christian work, supposedly carried out for Christ, there is very little  life ministered to people. (*Watchman Nee—A Seer of the Divine Revelation in the Present Age,* Chapter 11, Section 1)

He told me that when his co-worker, who was five years older than he,  was traveling through the country conducting evangelistic meetings,  Margaret Barber, realizing the peril of popularity, warned him by saying, "If you continue to  travel for evangelistic work, I will not pray for you any longer." She  had the foresight to realize that such work would bring shipwreck to his spiritual life. Eventually, that is exactly what happened. That other  co-worker was distracted from spiritual life to popular work. (*Watchman Nee—A Seer of the Divine Revelation in the Present Age,* Chapter 11, Section 1)

Disobedience was another thing Watchman Nee dealt with in order to maintain fellowship in the Lord's presence. His experience was that nothing, not even good and spiritual things, can substitute for obedience. For him to obey the Lord meant to cleave to the Lord's purposed will; it did not mean to take His permissive will as Balaam did (Num. 22:2-35). Anything which deviates from the Lord's purposed will is a form of disobedience. For him disobedience was a veil which would separate him from God's presence. He stressed that for him to receive light and revelation from the Lord he needed an unveiled face. Margaret Barber told him, and he passed it on to his close associates, that a small leaf on a tree can block out the full moon from one's sight. Since he realized that disobedience would cause the loss of God's presence, he made it his purpose to obey the Lord's will and the Lord's revelation at any cost. (Watchman Nee—A Seer of the Divine Revelation in the Present Age, Chapter 8, Section 2)

#### 21
He told us about going to Margaret Barber weekly, during his student days, to be rebuked. At those times when there was nothing to rebuke, she would ask questions until some fault was found; then she would rebuke him. He said that through this means he received excellent spiritual instruction. (Watchman Nee—A Seer of the Divine Revelation in the Present Age, Chapter 19, Section 10)

#### 22
Through Margaret Barber he became familiar with the books of D.M. Panton, Robert Govett, G.H. Pember, Jessie Penn-Lewis, T. Austin-Sparks, and others. (Watchman Nee—A Seer of the Divine Revelation in the Present Age, Chapter 4, Section 2)

One day I went by boat to Mawei to see Margaret Barber. I asked how she felt about my name being in the Methodist Church's book of life (what they called the church register). She replied, "I am afraid that among the names in that book of life many are dead and not a few are perishing." I said, "Should I have my name in a book of life on earth?" She replied, "If your name is recorded in the book of life in heaven, what good will an earthly book of life do you? And if your name is not recorded in the heavenly book of life, what will this earthly book of life profit you?" (Watchman Nee—A Seer of the Divine Revelation in the Present Age, Chapter 6, Section 3)

Though some had been saved, I was still not satisfied, because many in the school and in the town were still not saved. I felt the need to be filled with the Holy Spirit and to receive power from above that I might be able to bring more people to the Lord. Then I called on Miss Margaret Barber. Being immature in spiritual matters, I asked her if it was necessary to be filled with the Holy Spirit in order to obtain power to bring many to salvation. She answered, "Yes." I asked her concerning the means to be filled with the Holy Spirit. She said, "You must present yourself to God that He may fill you with Himself." I replied that I had already presented myself. But when I considered, I knew that I was still my old self. I knew that God had saved me, chosen me, and called me. Though I had not yet attained absolute victory, I had been freed from sins and evil habits, and many matters hitherto entangling me had been abandoned. However, I still felt the lack of spiritual power to cope with spiritual work. Then she told me the following story:

Brother Prigin was an American who had been to China. He had obtained a master's degree and was studying for a Ph.D. Feeling the condition of his spiritual life unsatisfactory, he sought the Lord and prayed. He said to God, "I have very strong unbelief; some sins I cannot overcome, and I have no power to work." For two weeks he asked God specifically to fill him with the Holy Spirit that he might lead a victorious life with power. God said, "Do you really want this? If so, do not take the Ph.D. examination two months from now, for I have no need of a doctor of philosophy." He felt he was in a dilemma. The Ph.D. degree seemed a sure thing; it would be a pity not to sit for the examination. He knelt down to pray and ask why God would not allow him to get the degree and be a minister as well. But here is a strange thing: Once God has made a demand, He sticks to it and never compromises with anyone.

The following two months were most painful. On the last Saturday of that period he experienced real conflict within. Did he want the degree or did he want to be filled with the Holy Spirit? Which was better: a doctor's degree or a victorious life? Others could be doctors and yet be used by God as well—why couldn't he? He was struggling and reasoning with God and was at his wits' end. The Ph.D. was dear to him and so was the filling of the Holy Spirit. But God would not give way. To choose a doctor's degree would make it impossible to live the spiritual life. To live the spiritual life would require forfeiting a doctor's degree. At length, with tears in his eyes, he said, "I submit. Despite my two years' study toward a Ph.D. degree, a goal which I have cherished for thirty years, ever since childhood, I have no alternative but to relinquish sitting for the examination for the sake of submission to God." Following this decision he wrote to notify the university authorities that he would not sit for the examination on Monday, thus abandoning hope for a Ph.D. degree once and for all. He was so exhausted that night that he could find no message to deliver the following day. So he simply told the congregation the story of his surrender to the Lord. On that day the congregation was revived. Three-quarters of them were in tears. He himself also gained strength. He said, "If I had known before that the result would be like this, I would have submitted earlier." His subsequent work was greatly blessed by the Lord, and he was one who had the deepest knowledge of God. (Watchman Nee—A Seer of the Divine Revelation in the Present Age, Chapter 7, Section 2)

Watchman Nee then gave this testimony of how he was healed: I had a lung problem, a kidney problem, a liver problem, and a heart problem. In 1923 I had peritonitis. I lay in bed for over a month. Breathing was painful to me. My fever was high and I was in much suffering. Brother Miao asked some saints to come and pray for me. When he prayed I felt nothing. However, when a certain sister, Miss Barber, prayed, "Lord, no one in the grave can praise Thee. If our brother dies, he will not be able to praise Thee," my heart was relieved, even though my fever was still high and I was still in acute pain. When the day dawned, I arose and walked to Lo-Hsing Pagoda to edit an issue of The Christian. If you do not have God's word, you must take care of your body. But if you have God's word, you should ignore the symptom. Treat the symptom as a temptation and a lie. Do not stay with the symptom; stay away from it. (Watchman Nee—A Seer of the Divine Revelation in the Present Age, Chapter 19, Section 8)

#### 26
Sister M. E. Barber, an English woman, is related to the genealogy of the Lord's recovery. When Brother Watchman Nee received the Lord, Sister M. E. Barber had been living in China for more than ten years. Initially, she was a missionary sent by a mission board to China in order to preach the gospel. However, because her co-workers were jealous of her, they fabricated charges against her and presented them to the English mission board. She had learned of the Lord not to vindicate herself. She did not disclose that she had been falsely accused until the chairman of the mission board said to her, “As your authority, I order you to tell me everything and not to hide anything.” After this matter passed, she felt that she could no longer remain with the mission. After another period of time, she felt that she should return to China, and the Lord opened a way for her to go. She came to Foochow at the mouth of the Min River and lived at Bai-Ya-Tan across from Mawei.

The history of the church in China shows that M. E. Barber was the first strong witness in China. She lived purely before the Lord and knew much of the cross and the Lord's life. Her deep experiences are evident in the hymns she wrote. One reads, “If there's less of earth joy, / Give, Lord, more of heaven. / Let the spirit praise Thee, / Though the heart be riven... / Lonely though the pathway, / Cheer it with Thy smile; / Be Thou my companion / Through earth's little while” (Hymns, #377). Another hymn she wrote is “He faileth not, for He is God” (Hymns, #693); this hymn is familiar to many people in Christianity. In addition, she also wrote other hymns, such as “Deep down into the depths of this Thy Name” (Hymns, #671), “Via Bethlehem we journey” (Hymns, #628), and “To the foe my word is always, ‘No'” (Hymns, #880).

Brother Nee not only mentioned Miss Barber in his messages; he also mentioned her a few times when I spoke to him privately. Every time he mentioned her, I received a deep impression. He said that every time he went to see Miss Barber, as he sat in the living room waiting for her, he would sense the presence of the Lord. On one occasion in 1936, as we were discussing the work and the service, Brother Nee sighed and said, “If only Miss Barber were still alive, our condition today would be completely different.” He also once said, “When I visited Europe and America in 1933, I visited spiritual people in both places, but it was not easy to find even one who could compare with Miss Barber. There was only one brother who seemed to be comparable to her.” Brother Nee said this in 1935, only two years after he returned from England. This shows that Miss M. E. Barber was very deep in her relationship with God; she genuinely knew God. She is a very weighty person in our history.

Brother Nee and his mother were both saved through Sister Dora Yu's gospel preaching. Brother Nee's mother was saved first and turned to the Lord, which influenced Brother Nee. Brother Nee was saved in 1920. Not long after his salvation, he and his mother met Miss Barber, and they went together to her home and were baptized by immersion. Brother Nee's mother frequently played mah-jongg prior to her salvation, even though she was a member of the Methodist denomination. However, after she was saved, she changed a great deal. When the two of them, mother and son, were baptized, our history began. From the time of his baptism Brother Nee was clear that Miss M. E. Barber had been prepared by God to lead him. In other words, Brother Nee gave himself completely to Miss Barber for her leading.

A number of other young people around the same age as Brother Nee also went to Miss Barber for her teaching. Regrettably, after a short time they left, one after another, because Miss Barber rebuked people severely. Brother Nee testified that Miss Barber rebuked him severely and even dealt with him unreasonably. However, after he was rebuked, he did not feel uncomfortable; on the contrary, the more he was rebuked, the more he felt the benefit. Thus, he continued to go to her despite the rebukes.

Miss Barber dealt severely with Brother Nee. Brother Nee and one of the other brothers were the most gifted among the young people of their generation; they were the best preachers. However, they usually did not get along, even in simple matters, such as opening and closing a door. Once, they asked Miss Barber who should carry out a baptism. Brother Nee thought that Miss Barber would have him do the baptizing because he had preached the gospel and led the person to the Lord. However, Miss Barber appointed the other brother to do the baptism. Later, Brother Nee asked Miss Barber why she had not allowed him to baptize. Miss Barber answered, “That brother is older than you, so he should do the baptizing.” Since the brother was older, Brother Nee could not say anything in response.

Not long after, there was another baptism meeting, and there were three brothers present who could baptize—Brother Nee, the older brother, and the third brother who was the eldest of the three. Brother Nee thought that according to age, the eldest brother would do the baptizing. Brother Nee wanted to see how Miss Barber would handle this matter. Miss Barber, however, appointed the same brother who had baptized the previous time. Brother Nee did not agree and went again to question Miss Barber. She answered, “I want to do it this way.” This seemed unreasonable, and Brother Nee could not take it. However, he later testified that Miss Barber's unreasonable dealings with him enabled him to receive the Lord's grace and mercy to place himself before her, because he knew that he could get much help from her.

After a few years Brother Nee and Miss Barber knew each other well and had deep fellowship; their affection for each other in the Lord was very deep and broad. When Miss Barber passed away in 1930, she left almost all her spiritual books, writings, letters, and Bibles to Brother Nee. Brother Nee said that if anyone were to write a biography of Miss Barber, he would be the best person to do it. He wanted to write Miss Barber's biography because he thought it would help the brothers and sisters in China. Regrettably, the Lord never gave him the opportunity to do this. Miss M. E. Barber is a seed in our history that grew in Brother Nee. Thus, when we speak of the history among us, we cannot avoid speaking of her.

Although the Baptist Church existed and sent brothers to China who baptized people, the battle for the truth concerning baptism did not really begin until God raised us up in China. Brother Nee's family first belonged to the Methodist denomination, in which they were sprinkled. After they were clearly saved and saw in God's Word the truth of baptism by immersion, they went to fellowship about it with Miss M. E. Barber. Miss Barber had already seen this matter. She brought this recovery concerning baptism to Foochow, and Brother Nee was baptized by immersion there in March 1921. From that time onward, baptism has been an important item of recovery among us.
