# Message 3 - The prerequisites of the believers' building up in the church, the Body of Christ (1)

We cannot just say, "I want to build."

Prerequisites. In college picking classes, if you want to take one class there is a prerequisite class to take first. There needs to be some preparation first to ready me for that class. In God's building work we must realise there are prerequisites involved. It is not just a matter of your zeal, ability, your given-ness that qualifies you to build.

Paul in 1 Corinthians says, let each man take heed how he builds. For another foundation no one is able to laid beside that which is laid which is Jesus Christ. If anyone builds upon the foundation gold, silver, precious stone, the work of each will become manifest, it is revealed by fire of what sort it is.

A serous word. On the one hand, Paul encourages us to build. At the same time he warns us that we must take heed how we build. You can build either with gold, silver, precious stones. Or you can build with wood, grass, stubble. There will be a day of testing. The fire will prove each one's work, of what sort it is. If we build with wood, grass, stubble which are all consumables, the bigger the pile the bigger the fire. If our work is of this category, in the footnote it says, they are related to our natural man, our fallen man. This is, if we build according to our natural trait, our natural life. We may be busy building. A lot time, a lot of energy, labouring for the church the work, but not knowing all I have been building is to pile up consumables ready for the fire to build up. But if I build with gold, silver, precious stone, not normally of big quantity. If a fire comes it will burn hay very readily. But gold you don't find in large abundance. Just a few ounces is priceless. These materials can withstand the fire. They can be tested by fire, can be proven by fire, and it will remain. In this portion of the Word Paul warned us, now we are involved in God's building. We all are participating in this divine building work of God. But we need to take heed, be careful how we build. Don't build with all these consumable things, you will find out one day it cannot withstand the fire. On the other hand if we exercise to truly build with gold, silver and precious stones, when the fire comes to test it we can withstand that test and be accepted by God.

So it is worthwhile to consider the prerequisites so we can be ready. Don't take on the matter of building so lightly. We need some time before the Lord to consider these items.

This message covers four prerequisites. They are somewhat a little more general. The next eight items are a little more specific and practical. But they are all important.

## I. We must realize that the Lord loves and wants to have a built-up church, not scattered individuals
Touches the matter of our **realisation**, our **thought.** **The Lord loves and wants to have a built up church**. Our participating is not because the people are nice, the environment is positive. Because we touch something on the Lord's heart, that He loves the church and wants to have a built up church.

Matt. 16, I will build my church. To build implies putting something together. Like building a house. There are piles of materials. Wood, steel, bricks, stone. You have to bring these materials together and then piece them together to become a wholesome structure. The Lord Jesus says, in Matt. 16, He was going to build the church.

I have met all kinds of people and I realised some people have the concept is that as long as I can get my work done, can do a good work, I preach the gospel and people respond and get saved, I get some numbers, I'm happy. With this person, there was no concept of building. His concept was work, success. But if you touch the Lord's heart, deep in the heart of God, He wants to see His people built up together. Not scattered. Constituted together and built up together. A very enlightening thought.

God was the first one who built. He built with Adam's rib into a woman. He brought that woman to Adam to be Adam's counterpart. That counterpart, that wife of Adam, was a building which signifies the church. Later Moses built the tabernacle and later David with Solomon built the temple. The tabernacle and the temple they built was something in the physical realm. But it is a building together of different materials to become one wholesome entity. That became the dwelling place of God. Then, when it comes to the NT then Jesus said I will build my church. In all these instances we see the revelation of building. This is something deep in the heart of God.

In 2 Sam 7, a story of David, after defeating all the enemies around, he had a thought that I am dwelling in a house of cedar but how about God? David somehow all of a sudden had a thought that he is dwelling in a comfortable place, but how about God? Within a curtain in a tent. Nathan came and encouraged him, whatever is in your heart do. Then Jehovah came through Nathan, I have not dwelt in a house since I brought the children of Israel up till this day. In all my going about did I ever speak a word to the tribes of Israel saying why not have you built me a house of cedar? ... This is one of the deepest prophesies recorded in the Bible. Who is qualified for this building? Mainly this matter, David had this thought of building something for God. God was so touched. It was not out of His demand that David would do something. Somehow David from His own initiative and he expressed this desire to build God a house. In Acts 7:32 God said David was a man after God's heart. Even without Him expressing it, David realised it. He probably learned from his forefathers about God's desire for a dwelling place. David wrote many psalms and expressed how he loved to be in God's dwelling place. Something in God's heart echoed God's heart.

This first prerequisite is related to our realisation. A kind of vision. In Christianity there is not such a vision. The workers just care to do their work. Who cares for this matter of building? Even in today's Christianity as these workers are doing this service for God, they compete with each other. Rivalry. You built a 5000 mega church. Full of rivalry, strife, division. In the heart of God He wants to gain a building. Who cares for that? David expressed this concern a God was pleased to the uttermost. He considered David a man after His own heart. Lord, what is my realisation? Have I seen the building is something on Your heart? Or is it because I'm a good organiser and I can get things going in a coordinated way? That is not building.

We must realise what the Lord loves. He loves the church. A built up church, not scattered individuals. At the end of the Bible we do not see many individual spiritual giants parading down the isle, showing off their spiritual experiences. No, at the end of the Bible we see the consummation of what's in God's heart, it's just a building. All the materials are brought together, built together. God is not a scattering God, He is a gathering God, a building God. Christianity takes the way of scattering, promoting individual talent. Don't need to be connected. This is the promotion, the atmosphere of the world we are living in. In the church life there is this atmosphere of being brought together, blending together, being built together.

### A. Babel

Trying to build a high tower. God came down to confound them with different languages so they could not communicate with each other. The work stopped and they were scattered. That was the origin of Babylon. Babel was the source of Babylon. The source of division as the result of God's curse. Today we are living in a world of many cultures, tongues, dialects. You have to realise this is a product of Babel due to man's rebellion. Mankind was divided into different tongues.

### B. Principle of gathering

We are gathered together with one another. Around the Lord. With one another. This is a wonderful thing. Jerusalem is in the principle of gathering. God charged them, wherever you end up in the good land, three times a year they needed to be gathered together in Jerusalem to testify they are still one people on the earth. Scattered into twelve places in the land. Didn't matter how far it was, how convenient it was. Today we have the seven feasts. In these last 25 years the Lord's recovery has been maintaining seven times a year. Not everyone can come, but there has been very good representation from everywhere. Can you imagine if there had not been the seven feasts in the last 25 years? I can certainly tell you it would have been gone. We all have been captured by the vision of the age. We don't want to do our own thing. We want to be a brother with all the other brothers. Through these coming togethers we are still together. Praise the Lord! This year we entered into 100 years. Not because we particularly like each other in a natural sense. The Lord has preserved us in the oneness of His Body. I hope the Lord will put this kind of realisation in us. We are against any kind of division, scattering.

## II. We must acknowledge that all the believers have been baptized in one Spirit into one Body and that God has placed the members in the Body and blended all the Body together
**Acknowledge what God has done**. God has already done something. In one Spirit we were all baptised into one Body. On the day of Pentecost the resurrected Christ came. The Body of Christ practically was born in the baptism of the Holy Spirit.

Christ has already done it. Why should we think of ourselves as different bodies? In His baptism only one Body was produced. We must acknowledge this. This is important. There is no place for any one of us to branch off and produce our own church, our own body. There is **only one Body**. It doesn't matter how many billions of believers there are, there is only own Body. We don't agree with the denominations. In God's Word we are shown clearly we all were baptised into one Body.

In the new man "there cannot be." A strong, emphatic word. There are no differences due to cultural background, social status, religious preferences. They mean nothing. We have been **brought to the same ground, the same level**, members of the same Body.

A young one may feel if I am here does not make much difference. No, as long as you are a child of God, no matter how new or young, you are an indispensable member. Maybe some of our members are weaker, like a little finger. But it's a needed member. I wouldn't get rid of it. If you want to have a proper Body, a healthy member, you need every member.

The eyes need the feet. We need to treasure every member in the Body. The strong ones should not feel they are all inclusive. The weak ones should not feel they are not needed, have an inferiority concept. I am a member in the Body and I am needed in the Body.

The uncomely members need more care, more love. The Body of Christ is not an army, where everyone is in uniform, a soldier. The Body of Christ is like a home, a family. Some are older, younger, stronger, weaker, smarter, not so smart. But every member is organically joined, connected. Not one member can be dispensable. Blended. Mixed together. The stronger one can be blended with the not so strong ones. The strong one prefers to be with the strong, the Chinese with the Chinese, the Korean with the Korean. Blending is to bring ones of different origins together to become a wholesome one. We need to Lord's blending.

One time in the training we had two sisters. One was very fervent and burning. When she prayed she had a lot to pray. She was paired with another sister who was not so burning. A little bit passive. Somehow they were paired. One time that aggressive stronger sister came to me and said when I prayed with this sister I prayed five times and she could barely pray one time. What can I do? She was trying to ask me to pair her with a stronger sister. I said sorry sister, it is not my choice. God has put you together to learn to blend. Learn to be blended together. After years of training the sister learned some lessons of blending. They became real vital companions. They learned to experience Christ.

To be blended means to be tempered, crossed out. For us to go through the cross, by the Spirit. 

## III. We must be in harmony with the fellow believers and be in one accord with the Body in prayer, which issues in the establishment of the church

Our **living**, our **attitude**. **Adjusted**. To **be in harmony** with our fellow believers. All the instruments need to be harmonised to play a beautiful music. We all have different sounds. The Lord wants us to be harmonised. Harmony is very beautiful. When you bring all the different voices together in a harmonious way they produce a very pleasant music. We must learn to always be in harmony with others. To be different from others is a shame. The Lord is blending us together. He wants to make us the same. 1 John 3, we all shall be like Him. Why shall you be different today? The Lord tries to make our differences stand out. That is the worldly way. In the Body we learn to be harmonised, to go along with our fellow believers and be in one accord. Any kind of dissension is not pleasing to the Lord.

All the 120 disciples prayed together for ten days. Then were being harmonised. Peter was being harmonised with John, with James, with all the brothers. That brought down the outpouring of the Spirit. The blessing of the Spirit was the result of the brothers being brought together in one accord through prayer. Pentecost was not an accident. It was the result of brother praying together in one accord.

It's not hard to say "I love you", but the real test comes when some decision is made, are we one with one another. We may say in a superficial way I love you. In a practical coordination, you have an opinion, I have an opinion, we cannot get along. We need to be in one accord, be brought into oneness. We have to be willing to sacrifice ourselves to go along with the other brothers. Instead of arguing just go along. The Lord treasures His believers living in harmony, in one accord.

To say Amen, should not just be something formal. Really, if we say Amen from our heart when another person prays or testifies. It means I agree, may it be so. One with that brothers prayer, testimony. Among all the Christian groups we say the most amens. We are full of amen. Amen will be filling the heavens, filling the universe. It is good to amen your brother's prayer. Sometimes we need to amen one another.

## IV. We must practice the oneness of the Divine Trinity in the Divine Trinity as the Divine Trinity does

The Divine Trinity is the reality of oneness. The practice is in the Divine Trinity. We practice as the Divine Trinity does. We practice according to how the Divine Trinity practices.

### A. The three of the Divine Trinity are continually practicing this divine oneness

Not something of our natural human agreement, accommodation. That is political. We are talking about oneness which is the very Triune God Himself. They are the reality of oneness. Even when the Son came to the earth, whatever He spoke or did was one with the Father. He would not speak a Word without the Father's speaking. He was seeking the Father's will, glory. The Spirit is to receive from the Son to express what the Son wants to do. The Father, Son and Spirit are altogether practising a oneness. No rivalry, no competition. 

The top virtue of the Triune God is His oneness. Oneness is the top virtue. The Father is one with the Son and the Son is one with the Spirit and the Spirit is one with the Father. The Father exalted the Son. This is My Son in whom I have found my delight. The Son honours the Father. He would never do anything that would draw attention to Himself He would like to bring them to the Father. And the Spirit is One with the Son.

None of them did anything for themselves but for the other party. In the world today can you find this kind of situation? Every person in the world is doing something for themselves. Here the three of the Divine Trinity live for each other. They are in perfect harmony.

Jesus always sought to be one with the Father. He is now the Head of the Body. We are under Christ to be His reproduction to live the same way the Head did.

### B. believers oneness incorporated with the Divine Trinity

In John 17, that they may be one *even as* I and the Father are one. The Lord desires His disciples to be one, just like He is one. Three aspects: life, word, glory.

That we would be in the Father's name. We have all been born of Him. The Father is our common source. It doesn't matter where you live, how you interpret the Bible. When you come to the **life**, we are the same. You may have different ideas, different opinions, but when you come to the life we are born of the same Father. We are all children of the same Father. How can we be different?

His sanctifying **Word**. Not doctrine. The divine reality which is God Himself expressed and realised. The world separates us, individualised. But when we come back to the divine truth we are sanctified from the worldly element and brought into a oneness with our brothers.

**Glory** is God expressed. No room for the self. Whenever the self is put aside the divine glory is here. In this glory every one of us, we all have been absorbed, filled with this God of glory. Here, in the divine glory, spontaneously we are one.

These three elements, the Father's name, the truth, the glory, are actually the three aspects of the Divine Trinity. So when we talk about the oneness, we are not taking about natural agreement, we are talking about being fully one with the Divine Trinity.

### C. The commanded blessing

Psalm 133 we see the Divine Trinity again. We need to enjoy the Divine Trinity thoroughly.

We enjoy the Father as the source with His blessing. We enjoy the Son with His element as the refreshing dew. We enjoy the Spirit as the application. like the oil, the ointment, anointing us. Only when we are enjoying the Divine Trinity we find ourselves in oneness. We need to be delivered from the self by fully absorbing the Divine Trinity. I hope this would be something so subjective to us. May the Lord be merciful to us to give us these prerequisites. So that we can practically enter into the oneness of the Divine Trinity.
