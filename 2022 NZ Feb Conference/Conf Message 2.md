# Message Two - Practicing the Church Life for the Building Up of the Body Christ

Why are we coming back to these things? Do not feel that because we're repeating these things, oh this is old stuff. Knowing is one thing, possessing it's reality is another.

Lord, gain this reality among us. This has much to do with the Lord's coming back.

The church life and the Body are not "against" each other. The local churches are for the Body and the Body is for the churches. The churches are the procedure for us to be ushered into the Body and are the expression of the Body. The Body is there supplying, being the supply for us to function in. Even in our local churches. So really, each local church should be just a miniature expression. Miniature but genuine, full. In size may be small, but in essence absolute. May the Lord recover His recovery to this degree. The local churches, the church life is not just doing certain things, meetings, services. Yes we do those things and I'm not down playing that. But the church life must be a group of people living this kind of life with the Triune God all the time. They don't live by themselves. They live by another life, the life of Christ. They deny themselves. They live together with the Lord.

Our number may be small compared to society but our testimony is real. Don't live an ordinary Christian standard. We must go higher. Let the vision really control us in a new way. God is not satisfied just to have local churches. He wants that one Body on the earth. I need a new understanding, a further, higher understanding of what the church is. I need my vision expanded, enriched, deepened. Thank the Lord for this ministry helping us. I saw a lot more now than when I came in. That should be normal and healthy. I hope after this conference your vision and burden is vastly expanded. Not as when you first saw it. How many of His children see this?

## I. After we see the vision of the Body of Christ, we need to practice the church life according to this vision
## II. Anyone who wants to live in the Body in a practical way must be in the local churches

When we're in the fellowship of a local church it is not the fellowship of that church only. The bread on the Lord's table is not just the believers in your locality. That bread includes all the members across time and space. The fellowship of the one Body of Christ. Our participation of Christ is universal. Administration may be local, but the fellowship of every church must be universal.

## III. The local church is a procedure and not the goal; the goal of a local church is the building up of the Body of Christ
Today we are building up and working out the New Jerusalem

## IV. The practice of the God-ordained way in the church life delivers the believers from hierarchy, the papal system, and the clergy-laity system for the building up of the Body of Christ
We are here to build up the function of all the member of Christ. We all need to exercise to rise up and stand against our disposition to function. In the meetings, in prayer, in service, in speaking for the Lord. Not by our own life but by the inner life of Christ.

The God ordained way must not be a movement. It is the way to build up the Body. By releasing the organic function of all the saints.

## V. As members of the Body, we need to have the consciousness of the Body and have a feeling for the Body

Whatever we think about doing, not only the elders, but all of us, even in our own personal lives. But if you are Body conscious, you would have the realisation, even the personal decision of this one private member can affect the Body. We live by a new kind of rule. 

Just think about the Body. Take care of the Body.

## VI. The blending of all the local churches should be as much as practicality allows, without boundaries of states or nations

Even technology is something allowed by God, to facilitate the coming together of the Body. So I even thank the Lord for this pandemic, so that we can use this technology to fellowship cross boundary, cross border, cross country. We are blending this way to have the reality of the Body of Christ.

Forget about autonomy. Does my finger declare independence. Autonomy is death. There are no autonomous parts in my Body. There are distinct parts but not autonomous parts.

If we are just local, just national, just continental, that is not the Body. The Body is universal. Today we are in the age of blending. The blending of the churches, the blending of the saints, to contribute to having the reality of the Body.

I want to be one who can be blended with all the saints. For that I must take the cross to deny, to overcome my natural preference, my natural life, my self, background, culture, national pride. I am not so small. I am a New Jerusalem being. I am a Universal Christian. I am a member in this one Body.

## VII. One of the tests of a genuine local church is that it should have fellowship with all the other local churches

## VIII. As members of the Body, we must allow ourselves to be limited by the other members and not go beyond our measure

The Lord has sovereignty given to every member a portion of grace. Some are this kind, that kind, smaller, larger. There should be no jealously, comparison, competition. The Head has given to so many members to build up the Body. We should be happy and praise the Lord about. What the Lord has given to me I would be faithful to serve.

## IX. Whatever we do in our locality or universally for the other countries should be done in a full realization that we are building up the Body of Christ; thus, we should always keep a view of the Body
