# Message 2 - Being God's fellow workers in the one work of the Lord's recovery

Many saints may not be that clear what the 'work' is. And what is the church? I am in the church preaching the gospel. Am I in the work?

The relationship of these crucial matters (church, ministry, work). Antioch.

Acts 13 **1** Now there were in Antioch, **in the local  church**, prophets and teachers: Barnabas and Simeon, who was called  Niger, and Lucius the Cyrenian, and Manaen, the foster brother of Herod  the tetrarch, and Saul.  **2** And as **they were ministering to the Lord and fasting**, the Holy Spirit said, Set apart for Me now Barnabas  and Saul **for the work to which I have called them**.  **3** Then, when they had fasted and prayed and laid their hands on them, they sent them away.  **4** They then, having been sent out by the Holy Spirit, went down to Seleucia; and from there they sailed away to Cyprus. 

In the setting of the church, five gifted ones. Among these gifted ones, who represent the ministry. They were in the church. Now the Holy Spirit says set apart these two for the work. What is this work? We understand the church. We understand these gifted ones ministering to the saints. This work is the spreading, the propagation of the gospel to raise up churches, to advance, to expand the Lord's testimony. Barnabus and Paul went out. They came back and gave a report to the church they were in. Then they went out again. The work is for the spreading, propagation, increase. It is the Body seeking increase. The church is just the Body being expressed locally. The ministry is the Body in function. To supply, strengthen the saints. The work is the Body seeking increase. These three matters constitute God's ordained way to carry out His economy for the building up of His Body on earth. It can't just be churches. The ministry is needed to strengthen and lead the churches. And the work is need to spread this testimony throughout the earth.

Eph. 4:11-12.  **11** And He Himself gave **some as apostles and some as prophets and some as evangelists and some as shepherds and teachers**, **12** For the perfecting of the saints unto the work of the ministry, unto the building up of the Body of Christ, 

Ascended Christ gave some as apostles, prophets, evangelists, shepherd and teachings. This is the ministry."Unto the work of the ministry unto the building of the Body of Christ." The church to which Christ gave the gifts. Unto the work. There is a work that needs to be carried out. The work of building up the Body of Christ.

Acts 13, Eph. 4:11-12. A clear understanding that these three entities are needed for God's operation to carry out his economy to build up His Body.

In Christianity we also see these three but not in the way ordained by God. We have the evangelicals who go everywhere to preach the gospel. Like the Billy Graham crusade. He did not care what church you go to. He only cared to get people saved. That was his work. A gospel work. Some have a portion of ministry, such as Austin Sparks. He had a great, top spiritual ministry to supply the saints. That was genuine. He built up his ministry center, that was all he cared for. Again the church you go to doesn't matter. Then there are some who only focus on building up their congregation. The bigger the better, glamorous cathedrals, mega churches. Their focus is on just getting people into their congregation. These three branches are altogether independent from each other. They even compete with each other. They are for their own existence. This is a shame. This is God's way to build up the body, but man used these different ways to promote their own agendas.

These three matters derive their existence from and work for the good of the Body. In Acts 13 those matters are so organically brought forth. Their is no organisation formed. No special system or program. It was these brothers and the Holy Spirit presiding over them to send them forth for the work. They were ministering not just for Antioch but in the context of the Body. Their being sent out was not a work of Antioch but of the Body. These three matters derive existence from the Body. Without the Body there is no work, no church, no ministry. They find their place in the Body. They must fit themselves in the Body. Otherwise they make no sense. They must be working for the good of the Body. This can't be overemphasised. Without keeping this principle everything is man made not God created. These three matters is according to God's ordained way. Very logical. Very spontaneous. Anything we human beings try to do that makes each aspect an independent branch, is altogether man made. Setting up a mission board, a ministry center. Not according to the way God created. Christianity also sets up seminaries to train preachers. Jesus never set up seminaries. What about the full time trainings. They are not seminaries, not bible schools. Places where the young people can be trained and perfected to learn the truth. The trainings are not a work in itself, it is incoordination and among the churches. This training is carried out in relation to the churches. It is not an independent entity.

I treasure these three matters. We have to carry them out, not as separate branches independently, having nothing to do with each other. If I'm evangelical, don't use your ministry to interfere with what I'm doing. I don't care about their spirituality. I don't care if they have a church to go to. Even these three branches cannot work together. But these three matters flow together in the context of the Body. There is no contention. No conflict. No jealousy. Every part works for the good of the Body. I hope we see this, brothers. We want to go back to what God created. Not what man made to fulfil man's ambition and pride.

How about us? We have many local churches where there are elders. In the Lord's ministry there are brothers who minister the word. Teachers or prophets, "co-workers". There are workers who go to many places. To India, Cambodia, Africa. We also have these three so-called branches among us. I want to use the Lord's move to Russia as an example. When brother Lee was touched by the Lord and he felt it was time to go to Russia, to spread the Lord's recovery there. He called an urgent conference. He opened up this matter to them. Then the churches responded. In 1991 it was the completion of the first graduates of the training. The churches rose up to respond and sent saints there in the midst of winter to preach the gospel. In that work, that was a wonderful pattern. How the minister, the churches and the work worked together to bring about now almost 200 churches. What a glory! What an advancement of the Lord's work on the earth. It was not brother Lee or the churches work alone. Not just some workers going out. All were in coordination together in much fellowship and harmony. This is among us on the positive side. Also we have failures. We have workers who are going about many places with a certain commission to do a gospel work. The intention was good. They went to places with an existing church, they had no regard to fellowship with the elders in that place. Their agenda was to do their work. Regardless what the elders say or the church is doing, they do something in parallel. Eventually that work became a conflict to the church there. It produced a kind of unpleasantness. What about the ministry. We had brothers who are gifted who wanted to draw people to their area. You are under my ministry. You should follow me. Causing discord among churches. The ministry should never be for the ministry itself. It should always be for the churches. We have shortages, maybe not as extreme as Christianity. We can revisit this matter.

The work - the Body seeking increase. In each local church there may be work - with the children, young people, campus. There are these works under the church. But in the NT with the work it is talking about the Body reaching out seeking increase everywhere. Whatever, whether local work or universal work. It should never create interference with the church or the ministry. Without the ministry how can the churches survive? The ministry is not here to control anyone. The ministry is here to supply God's children. Not receiving the ministry doesn't make you not a local church but it will make you a weak church. A proper church living in the Body you would have the sense, we want to give financially and sent one to participate in the work. Some of the saints sent to Russia never came back. It was okay. The sending churches didn't expect to get them back. These three matters are extremely crucial. 

This message is on the fellow workers. We all can and should be a fellow worker. Some may think, brother James you are a co-worker, it's easy to say. Some saints asked me when did you become a co-worker? What qualification did you have? I didn't know how to answer, because I don't know. I just began to server and get more involved. A co-worker is not a rank or a title. An elder is not a title. We don't have such a system. If you are truly and elder you have to manifest your capacity as an elder. That function will manifest you are a proper elder for that church. Same thing for co-workers. We are just simply those who have been charged by the Lord to be involved in different aspects of the work. It is my privilege to be a part of the Lord's work. Same thing in ministering the word. Don't think you can go through different classes. There is not such thing. You have to seek the Lord, pursue the Lord, then with the portion the Lord gives you you would manifest such a gift.

These three matters and distinct, but they should not be separated. They need to be very closely related. If you separate them you will get into trouble. If you do not see the key factor of the seeing of the Body. If you do not see the Body your church will not be a healthy church. Only what results in the building up of the Body is proper. The churches, ministry and work will be proper if all properly oriented to the building up of the Body.

## I. Our work is the work of the Lord’s recovery for the building up of the Body of Christ; this work is according to the heavenly vision of the crystallized significance of the Body of
Christ

The one work is simply the work of building up the Body of Christ. Your preaching the gospel, raising up the churches are for this one work. If you can teach or ministry, it also should be part of this one work. As a good elder, that is also should be part of the one work of building up the Body of Christ.

The Triune God mingled with humanity is what the Body of Christ is. A divine-human constitution. If, in your building up of the church, carrying out of the ministry, there is no Divine Trinity involved, just your eloquence, it is just wood, grass and stubble. Sorry, the bigger the pile, the easier to burn. The building material is gold, silver, precious stone. They signify the Triune God. This is what we are building with.

What is the Lord's recovery? God became man. Man became a life-giving Spirit. Intensified to produce the church. The Spirit was intensified as the seven Spirits to produce overcomes to build up the Body of Christ to consummate the New Jerusalem. All the churches must bear this testimony of the Lord's recovery.

You don' have to be a co-worker to be a fellow worker with God. Just a brother serving in the children's meeting or book sales. If you have this view you will realise even as I am handling the book sales I am a fellow worker with God. I am not selling books just to keep myself busy. You are a fellow worker using the ministry books to dispense the truths to the saints. This can be applied to all of us. You don't have to be a co-worker speaking on the platform, traveling and giving conferences. In 1 Cor, Paul was talking to the saints. We all should be fellow workers. How wonderful if all the brothers and sisters. Sisters can be a fellow worker with God. We have many sisters, also fellow workers with God in doing this one work. You don't need to arrive at a certain rank. No, just serve under a vision, mingled with the Triune God.

There is such a thing as the work of the Body. Is your management of the church a work of the Body? If not you will tend toward an independent isolated local church. Our work must be the work of the Body. If you are gifted to minister for the Lord. That should be, needs to be, the work of the Body. Not the work of so-and-so, with saints drawn to you. That becomes cancerous. We have this experience already in our history. When you are sent out to the gospel, out to the Pacific Island to preach the gospel. Never think it's your work or NZ's work or Australia's work. It must be the work of the Body. I have been going with brother Dick to Africa. Just because brother Lee sent us, it doesn't mean Africa is my work. I never had that view. Africa is the Body's work. There are a good number of brothers travelling, ministering, spreading. Local brothers also raised up. Some in South Pacific, in all the churches. None of these works and the work of some people. That would be ugly. That would bring us to a peril of division, of degradation. Last night I said what a mercy we are kept to the 100 year anniversary. No one can imagine this would happen. We should have been disbanded. All the co-workers, no one is competing. We all serve together. We invite one another. Just because I was serving in Australia the brothers felt to invite other co-workers to come. Wonderful. No sense of jealousy. That is ugliness. Degradation to the uttermost. By and large the recovery is still healthy and I thank the Lord. Works are going on all over the world. Many from Taiwan. Now we have Taiwan co-workers involved in Germany. And in Africa. Isn't this wonderful? This is the Body's work. This is not any person or any church's work.

## II. In the Lord’s move in His recovery, there should be only one work, not different works

Don't be so small to be limited to your territory. We have to do one work. This is the work of the whole earth.

I'm very hopeful we will be the people who will bring the Lord Jesus back.

AS I said I'm involved in the Lord's work in Africa. A phenomena that many African students went to China to study. The saints there were able to reach out and gain a good number. Not just a few. 1000s. They are meeting in the church life. Because of this, the saints in China had this view, all these ones will go back to Africa. This is not the trophy of China. They sought fellowship with the serving ones in Africa. How can these ones be connected and remain in the church life in Africa. In China they are reaching more countries than we could in our work in Africa. Students from over 50 countries. But the Lord brought us together to have fellowship and prayer. This is not China's work of Africa's work, this is the Body's work.

## III. According to the picture in Song of Songs 7:11, Christ’s lover wants to carry out with her Beloved the work that is for the entire world (fields) by sojourning from one place to another (lodging in the villages):

By this time the seeker had attained a level of spiritual maturity. The second to last chapter. Now she is ready to work with her lover, to go to the fields, to the entire world. Brothers, just to care for NZ or the South Pacific is just a portion. We should go to the whole earth. The more you grow, the more maturity you have, the larger your capacity will be to embrace not just a church or a region but the whole earth.

Brother Lee wasn't trying to compete with brother Nee. They were absolutely one to carry out God's interest throughout the earth. Through brother Lee being sent to Taiwan and eventually the US he had an open door to reach the rest of the world, not the Lord's recovery is reaching the whole inhabited earth. Can you imagine, even in some forbidden countries in the Middle East. There is a church in Jerusalem. Can you believe? This is not any man's work. This is the Lord's recovery.

## IV. We need to be God’s fellow workers in the one work of the Lord’s recovery according to the following principles

Fourteen points. If we don't take care of these principles we can fall into snares.

### A. bear the testimony of the Body of Christ. (1)

What has brought the saints to all follow the same speaking to bear the same testimony? We don't bear a local testimony.

Of course you cannot change the skin colour. In Africa you will see the black skin colour. But if they express the black flavour that would be degradation. There is no local flavour. We cannot change the colour or language. It's what you express.

The church as the One New Man has the highest demand. It restricts you from doing anything that is only for yourself locally. Anything you do should fit in the direction of all the churches in the Body of Christ.

### B. under consideration of the other churches, trying to be the same (2)

1 Thes., be imitators of the churches. Not outwardly. No, we have to imitate one another in our expression, in our bearing the testimony. All the churches should be exactly the same. Why should we be different? We all have the same Lord Jesus in us. There should be a divine sameness we express in all the churches.

Two million Israelites. Only one Ark, one tabernacle.

To be different is a shame. God is making us all the same. You don't want to be the same today? One day you will be the same. When He appears we all shall be like Him. Why should you be different? Not in the sense of being unified. 

### C. Do not promote your place (3)

### D. Do not attract people to your place (4)

Isn't this a safe guard? No local church needs to try to attract people or impress people, we are the stronger church, the better church. You need the unique attraction, Christ and the church.

### E. Do not say your way is better (5)

Some churches have said they have the way. The more you promote your way it brings in the thought of division. Even the God-ordained way. Brother Lee never meant it to be a method, that some places practice and produce a good result and wave a flag, my way is the genuine way, your way is not the genuine way, it does not work. 

### F. Don't measure churches or persons by your experience and way (6)

### G. Avoid doing or saying anything that would stir up concern of the saints (7)

There are faithful saints you don't know of. They may not be eloquent, but they are pure. Watching what we say and do. If we say or do something inappropriate they will be concerned.

money, sex, temper - these are things that many servants of God have become loose and casual over and have caused saints to have concern.

### H. Do not be suspicious of others (8)

This is a disease.

### I. work not for only your church but the entire recovery (9)

### J. Do not cut yourself off from the Body (10)

So easy for us to stumble and be stumbled. Forgiveness is a virtue in the church life.

### K. Minister life where ever you go, build up churches wherever you are. (11)

### L. Consider all churches, co-workers and saints the same (12)

### M. Do not build a special group around you (13)

### N. Do not try to convince your way is best; do not say or do anything that would damage the Lord's recovery. (14)
