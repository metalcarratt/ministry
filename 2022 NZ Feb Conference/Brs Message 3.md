Ray - There are so many problems in the NT. When we stay in the realm only of the churches we are always dealing with problems. But when we get into the divine realm, this is a divine realm. You have the Triune God who built Himself into humanity and not in resurrection is building Himself into us. That mingling is the reality of the Body of Christ. You can have the church life without that. It may not have grown and development. We are talking about the development of that life. In this realm, there are no problems. Is that true? If you are mingled with God, in that realm, there are no problems. There is just the Triune God mingling with us. It is what brother Lee calls the divine and mystical realm.

To see the church, ministry and work are not three unrelated activities. They are all aspects of the one Body. If you take the Body out they don't have meaning. When you have it in the context of the Body it's building up a divine and mystical realm. I don't care who is speaking as long as the Triune God is flowing. All of the speaking is good. That realm, when you're in the Triune God, everything is positive. Out of the Triune God, then you have the problems.

# Message 3 - Being a proper person in the Church, the Ministry and the Work

It is God's design to work out His economy through these three aspects. These three matters, although distinct and not the same, different functions, different realm, they cannot be separated. They are all working out of the same source, working together for the same goal, the Body of Christ. I hope this has been made clear to us.

Now, even though you may be clear concerning these three aspects. You have some understanding of what it means to work with God. Now another crucial matter is the matter of the person. I'm very burdened about this matter. It still comes down to you. What kind of person are you? From our history and from church history, the problem has not been so much with the way, the goal, the view, the problem has always been with the person. What kind of person? Even though you may be given the clearest vision, way. If the person is wrong, even though the way is correct. You will not be able to work out what that vision intends. We should not blame the vision or the way. We must blame ourselves. Lord, have mercy on me. Constitute me, make me the right person.

## I. The principle in God's work is to gain persons, and by gaining them to have a way to go on to carry out His economy

What does it mean to gain a person? The Lord needs to gain *persons* and by gaining them have a way to go on. Just being saved and justified, it doesn't mean we are fully gained by Him. Acts 9:15, Paul's conversion. A chosen vessel to Him. A useful vessel. To be gained by God is for God to gain a vessel. A vessel is a container. God is looking for a vessel. An open vessel. A useful vessel. Whom He can come in to fill, to saturate. We have a treasure in earthen vessels. God desires to gain, not main instruments, many tools to use. As far as preaching the gospel is concerned, strictly speaking, He has millions of angels to do that. God does not need help in that sense. But God needs vessels into whom He can enter. Who would allow themselves to be a vessel for God to come in. When Gabriel visited Mary to announce the good news. Mary upon hearing the word said, Let your word be fulfilled in me, as you said. She just availed herself, whatever it may be, since it's your will, let it be done in me. She didn't say I need to do this and do that. She just offered herself as a vessel to God to do what he pleased. I have heard many saints come to the microphone to consecrate. I will come to every meeting, read the Bible every day. To consecrate ourselves to God means to empty our hands. That's what the word consecrate means. To have our hands filled with Christ. Empty all the worldly things but also religious thoughts. Empty that. Make my hands available for God to fill. When the priests were being sanctified they opened their hands to let the sacrifice be put on their hands. It is not we are determined to do this or that for God. That is your own determination, not consecration. Consecration is to allow God to do what He pleases in you. Saul of Tarsus was a chosen vessel to God. After reading the 14 epistles of Paul this is what brother Lee concluded. "open vessel" He was capable, gifted, more advanced that his contemporaries. But he did not serve God using his talents. This is what we mean by proper persons, by rendering God our cooperation.

God needs man's cooperation. You think, I need to help God to do this. I need to do this, go there, go here. This is still our thought of cooperation. The cooperation God needs is for us to make ourselves available to Him. Don't resist Him, don't block Him. The work God wants to carry out by myriads of angels, but God does not want to work that way. He wants men, men who in their humanity allow divinity to be worked into them in a mingling way so that divinity would be lived our through humanity, to live out and express a life. This is the work God wants to see. In 2 Sam, when David wanted to build a house for Gods dwelling. God told David through Nathan, I appreciate your thought for me. But before you can do that, I need to build a house for you. From your own loins a seed will come forth. After you sleep with your fathers, implying this will happen after you die. After you die. Then a seed will come forth and he will built a house for me. Literally that was Solomon but prophetically Christ. That was the seed that prophesied to David.

I hope we can have a new understanding of what it means to consecrate to God. A few years ago we had a young brother who went to the third year full time training in Boston. A gifted young man who loved the Lord and was capable. When he went there he thought he would become useful. He was eloquent, gifted. Rolling up his sleeves, ready to work, ready to go to any campus, show you what I will do. The place he was put, he was able to meet any students. Sometimes he was just there sitting, no appointments. He was so frustrated. Then I told him, brother, you thought you are here ready to do something for God, ready to show what you can do. But God wants to do something in you first. Hudson Taylor, one time a young man wanted to go to join the mission field, he came to see Hudson Taylor and Hudson asked him to wait. After 15m, 30m, the young man wondered how long it will be. He waited another hour. The young man eventually got fed up and left. Then the secretary came and told Hudson Taylor. Hudson said, he should have gone. If he cannot wait for me for one hour, he will not be able to wait for the Chinese people for ten years. He thought he was ready to go but he needed God to work into him to wait. If you go to that idolatrous country you going to endure people ignoring you, rejected you. I believe that fellowship helped that brother. 

How about you? Are you the right person? Am I the right person? God appreciated David's heart, no doubt. But David was not the person who could do that. David at that point typified us who need God to build a house. Through the death, the sleeping, something would come forth from us who would built the house.

We are God's masterpiece, poem. So people can read something of God in us. The unique work, the central work that God is doing is to work Himself into man. That is the central work, the unique work. The priority is for God to work Himself into us first.

God will not just work some patience into you. God will work *Himself* in you. Christ will be *formed* in you. Not just the love, the power of Christ. Until *Christ Himself, the entire Person* is formed in you. You need *Christ* as your patience, *Christ* as you love. The word formed implies a process of growth, of maturity.

I have seen so many dear, gifted, capable brothers. They were so zealous. They became very work driven. I want to have ten people saved this year. I want to have twenty added to the church this year. Like a businessman. It's good he has a goal, a plan. But at the same time he became very self-assertive. Very presumptuous, that he could really produce something on his own, by his own strategizing. We do need to make plans. Brother Lee encouraged the saints to bear fruit, to make a vow to the Lord. Don't live a kind of aimless Christian life. But after making such a goal you must be very conscious of the fact you cannot carry out this goal. I cannot do this out of myself. I want to let you do it through me. You honour this desire I have. I don't want to become presumptuous.

Whatever kind of person you are, that's the kind of fruit you produce. I knew a brother who would get many people saved. But he was a very worldly people. He liked to play golf and brought many of his golf friends to the Lord. Interestingly, nearly every fruit he bore never remained. In fact became very negative. He got them saved but also got them stumbled. These ones, saved by him were also stumbled by him. This is a matter of the person.

M.E. Barber, God pays more attention to what we are than what we can do for him. There is a lust within fallen man to do something, do be work driven. God needs to deliver us to see from 2 Sam 7, we need God to first work Himself into us. Before something can come forth from me to build His house.

## II. If we have seen the Body, we will conduct ourselves in the church, the ministry, and the work in a way that is without ambition, without self-boasting, without making comparisons, and without blaming others for their mistakes
What does it mean to be a proper person. I'm ethical, moral, educated, good manners. Sometimes we look at the person by the outward appearance. Not tattooed and colour hair, piercing everywhere. When we say proper person we are not talking about that. A person who does not live for himself. A person without ambition, self-boasting, making comparison or blaming others. A person who does not put himself at the center.

Every human being on the earth is not a proper person. It is very difficult to find a proper person. One who does not live for himself. Who is not ambitious, not self centred. Man likes to show off, take credit. This is what politics and the business world is about.

Who doesn't think they are better than others. You always think of yourself more excellent than the other way. Because of the fall.

Brother Lee said so many time, I only know to labour. I never had the thought I would be the leader in the Lord's recovery, that he would be the successor to brother Nee. When he was with brother Nee many people didn't know who he was. He never tried to project himself. So actually, you ask a lot of Christians then, they didn't know who he was. He testified, he only knew to labour. I'm grateful I'm in a recovery led by these two brothers who didn't live for themselves. They were a proper pattern of a NT minister who lived or God's interests absolutely. When brother Lee first met brother Nee, he struggled with the Lord because he had a work he would have to give up in northern China. Now he was invited to join brother Nee to join him in Shanghai. He had to struggle with the Lord. He came to this realisation, if God is going to do something in China, there cannot be two streams, there can only be one stream. I cannot have a stream in the north. God wanted him to give up his work, his ministry, and go down to Shanghai to join brother Nee. He submitted to brother Nee like submitting to his own father. That was God's preparation. Today in the whole Christianity I dare you to find two Christian workers who can blend and coordinate like this. Instead you can find dozens of examples of two who split up in rivalry, in competition. 

Only know to labour. Forget about the title. Forget about eldership, co-worker ship. You are who you are by the grace of God. Just keep labouring and who you are will be manifested. You don't need to be anxious to make yourself something you are not. In due time God will manifest. Let God decide.

## III. In the church, the ministry, and the work, we must beware of pride

This is the root of the problem of a person. The cause of Satan's rebellion. He was obsessed with pride. To be an arch-angel under God was not enough. He wanted to go higher. Five times, I will. I will. He was so proud. This is the one who injected his sin into the fallen man. That sin is still in us, in our flesh. We are the children of the devil. We were. We inherited the gene of the devil. That gene is characterised by the word pride. As long as that pride is not killed, not dealt with, we will have problems.

Prov.16:18, Pride goes before destruction. A haughty spirit before a fall. Even Solomon realised, if you are proud, just wait for the destruction. 

1 Tim 3:6, 6:3-4. Pride blinds people. A blind man. Without any sight. Only know yourself. Years ago I was in a church with a little problem and a rebellion was taking place. One brother of about 15-20 who was not an elder but was in that church for the longest time. He stood up and said, among all of you, I am actually the most qualified to be an elder. I'm a medical doctor, beautiful family, everything is perfect. My father was an elder and asked why you are not an elder yet. When I heard a word like this I almost fell off my chair. Can a person speak like this? He was proud to the uttermost. Proud of his profession, family, legacy in the church life. He dared to say this in front of us? Then he slammed the chair on the ground and walked out. I could never forget this. How can a brother say this and do this? Pride had obsessed this person.

Some announced Christ out of selfish ambition. That was painful to Paul. Preaching the gospel, out of envy, out of selfish ambition. Yet, I still rejoice as long as Christ is announced. They preached Christ to show off. They were not genuine preachers. They did it out of envy. To compete with Paul. Paul said I rejoice, as long as the gospel can be preached.

Brother Nee's poem, Let me love and not be remembered, let me serve and not be respected. He does not want to be noticed, rewarded. He just wants to do what was on the Lord's heart. Self was absent in this brother and God could use Him so much.

Lord, do I consider myself more highly than I should think? If you put a cup on a table it could fall and break. If you put a cup on the floor it is less likely to break. 

These things will catch up with us. If you leave them unchecked ,they will catch up with you and destroy you. And not only you but the Body and the church.

James 4:6 God resists the proud and give grace to the humble. I don't want God to resist you? That's the last thing you want. For God to block you? Don't think you are the super man. God does not have to bless you. If you carry out your prideful ways, God will resist you and will give grace to the humble.

## IV. In the Lord’s recovery we must avoid the following divisive factors:

### A. doing an extra work

We are only doing the one work. The building up of the Body of Christ. To do an extra, secret, private work, will cause division. You may say you're doing a children's work. That's not what we mean. In the building up of the Body of Christ there are many departments. For a phone, some design the circuitry, casing, etc. But all for the purpose of building a phone. But if one manager decides they want to make the best screen, I don't care about the other things. The screen is what I'm promoting. You're working for that company. But you perfected the screen so well you sell it to the other companies. You are doing a work within the work. In the Lord's recovery we are doing one work. The campus work, the children's work are for the one work. We still have ones who use the life studies, the ministry books, saying they will feed the Christians, but they put them into their own pocket.

### B. regionalism

Peter and Paul were one group of co-workers. Europe apparently is a region. But in the Lord's work, these are not different regions. This thought has to be removed from us. It doesn't matter where we live. The workers are prone to keep their own territory. If we by the Lord's mercy see what the Body is, we will know what it is to do one work.

### C. not allowing mingling with others work

It is so wonderful through the modern means of technology we can have more fellowship

### D. wanting to be someone

### E. neglecting keeping the one accord

## V. We must be right in following others; that is, we should be careful in following any co-worker whom we appreciate and to whom we are attracted
Paul says to "imitate me". We should not have the feeling that I want to be unique, to stand apart. This is a worldly thought. I want to imitate the co-workers. But not foolishly. Not because this one has a certain history, I just follow him. There's a book, The Word of Love. Brother Lee gave to the co-workers. Be right in following others. Be careful. We are encouraged to follow each other, the leading ones, the co-workers. Closely follow my teaching, my conduct (2 Pet 3:1). Not just his teaching but who he is.

Don't just follow an eloquent, capable person. One who really loves the Lord, lives the Lord. All the time renounces the natural life.

## VI. In carrying out God’s New Testament ministry, we need to apply the fivefold standard established by the Lord Jesus in His ministry

Fivefold standard of the NT ministry. Categorised what the NT ministry is.

1. not doing anything out from the self. John 5:19, the son can do nothing form himself except what he sees the father doing
2. not doing our own work. 4:34, my work is to do the father's work
3. not speaking his own word. the words I say to you I do not speak from myself
4. not doing anything by our own will. 5:30, I can do nothing from myself, as  I hear I judge, I do not seek my own will but the will of him who sent me
5. not seeking our own glory. 7:18 he who seeks the glory of him who sent him

Christ came from God, did nothing from himself, did not do his own work, own word, own will or for his own glory. This is a measuring stick for our own ministry.

## VII. With us, as with the Lord Jesus, there should be no distinction between life, work, and move

You can see some impressive televangelist speaking away then go their home and see all kinds of degradation and corruption. Christian workers have many lives. In the religious world it is like this. The working world is the same.

The pattern we see of the Lord Jesus, his living was his work. Mark 1. He went about, it was just his living and also his work. No difference. At the meeting we have a certain front. That shows our person is not right.

## VIII. The hindrance to seeing the vision of the Body and to practicing the Body is the self

As soon as we see the Body our life and work as individuals cease. The Body life and individualism cannot exist together.

## IX. A person who touches God’s heart and is an overcomer in the eyes of God is one who is living in the Body and practicing the Body life
