"Lord, thank You, you're praying for all the seeking saints in your recovery to know and live in the divine and mystical realm. Grant us to know that the processed Triune God is the divine and mystical realm. The way you lived on the earth, we would all live that way. Thank you for making it clear that speaking, teaching and ministering is a battle and requires much prayer. We join you now seated in the heavenlies to carry out this battle in the air. We aim our prayer to the earth that what is on your heart would reach 1000s of saints right now. May you be glorified and the enemy be put to shame."

Overview of divine and mystical realm.

- What do we mean by the word "mystical"? 

- Vision. The processed God and the pneumatic Spirit. The more we will experience so many aspects of the Lord's saving life. Living simultaneously in the physical realm and the divine and mystical realm.

- Connection between living in the physical realm and divine and mystical realm, when He comes secretly we will not be those left behind but those taken to the throne.

**Definition of the word mystical**. We are not talking about a group of people in the middle ages called 'mystics'. Trying via contemplation or causing themselves to suffer to contact God. The book *Divine and Mystical Realm*. Our understanding of mystical is that there is a profound truth which is far beyond our capacity to know or understand. Mystical refers to a realm of divine reality that is far beyond our sense. We can't see it, hear it, touch it, inhale it. Way beyond the capacity of our mind, no matter how intelligent we are, it can only be made known through the mingled spirit by the divine revelation. 

Just come as an open vessel and pray sincerely.

# Message Two - The Divine and Mystical Realm

Experience must have a foundation, a vision.

## I. All the saints in the Lord's recovery need to have a clear view, a vision, concerning the physical realm and the divine and mystical realm

[A] Sharp contrast. Earthly vs heavenly. Judicial vs organic. Objective vs subjective. Physical vs mystical.

[B] Enter a realm much higher than where we are now. Br Lee addressed all of us, You are not in this realm. I'm just in this physical realm. He had the future of the Lord's recovery in view.

[C] We enter by seeing. To see is to enter. Hearing is deeper than seeing. When the Lord was speaking to the messengers to the seven churches He said at the end, let he who has an ear. Genuine seeing is the issue of hearing. An open ear. A blood cleansed ear. Open to the Spirit's speaking. This is not a conference, this is a training. He wants to speak to each one of us. A training is where the Lord wants to touch us. He wants to teach each one of us in a particular and crucial way. Are you open for this? You will be blessed surely by this.

## II. The Triune God Himself is a divine and mystical realm

We cannot enter into the Godhead Himself as a realm. We need to know the truth concerning God Himself.

[A] Self existing, ever existing, co existing, co inhering, the Three dwelling in One another. The gospel of John itself is entirely mystical. The Word was with God, the Word was God, the Word became flesh. That's mystical. Ch 3, Living on the earth but also living in heaven. Ch 14, The Father's house, I am in the Father and You are in Me and I am in You. This is mystical. 

## III. The divine and mystical realm into which we may enter today and in which we may live is actually not simply the divine and mystical realm of the Triune God; it is the divine and mystical realm of the consummated Spirit and the pneumatic Christ.

[A] The Spirit has become the consummated, all-inclusive, compound Spirit. The Triune God who has passed through the process. All these aspects are in the consummated Spirit. When we are abiding and living in the consummated Spirit, the indwelling Spirit knows exactly where we are and what we need. You're here and an open vessel. I'm going to minister the humanity of Jesus, applied the effectiveness of His death. When we are in this realm, the all-inclusiveness is here and it's inexhaustible and immeasurable.

We are still learning, sometimes in the physical realm and sometimes in the divine and mystical realm. Let the Lord come into you and let him minister to you right now.

[B] Christ has become the pneumatic Christ. 

We want it to become real to us, actual, personal. Really living in this realm. Really becoming more and more to us. Becoming a constituent of our being so that when we speak of it it's not just an objective truth but a testimony. Some older saints you can just tell, they are in their 70s, genuinely well into the realm of maturity, and here are some other saints who haven't grown at all for the last 30 years. But the Lord gives up on no-one. I've been saying again and again to the older staints, it's not too late. The Lord is well able to redeem the time and restore the years the locusts have eaten. Just press on. 

## IV. In our experience we actually become part of the divine and mystical realm of the consummated Spirit and the pneumatic Christ

[A]. You become part of the divine and mystical realm is through birth. How did you become part of the human realm? You were born into it. The concern is how much growth and development there is, but we have all being born into this realm.

[B] Become part of the realm by participating in God's life, nature, mind, being, image, glory, sonship, manifestation and likeness.

[C] By being built up in the Body. There's a limit to how much we can participate in the divine and mystical realm personally, especially if you're individualistic. I am here with you by the Body. When we realise this our participation enlarges.

Blended. Particular and positive concern. Are you blended? How is the leadership in your locality? Is someone there a king? Or does one have an important function but blended with the other brothers. 

I want to ask this question. About your personal relationship with the Lord in your daily living. Your personal, intimate contact. We are all in the local churches. We all participate in what the leading brothers are directing us to do. So we have the HWMR week by week. Then the prophesying meeting is based on this. We have this ministry portion to read day by day and this Bible portion to read. But that's corporate. Where are you personally? We all have different needs based on where we are. Lord, what book of the NT should I be in for my own experience and growth? You might just read ten minutes a day. But if there's not a personal relationship, intimate fellowship with the Lord, then we are only taking in what the whole church is taking in (and we should). But what I need is far different from what my granddaughter needs. Her needs need to be met where she is and mine need to be met where I am.

## V. As believers in Christ, children of God, we should live in the divine and mystical realm

[A] Matt 23, one teacher. Lord, I need to learn in this wonderful realm. Lord, I don't think I know hardly anything. He knows where we are. He just wants to care for us where we are. To learn to live in this wonderful realm. I'm learning day after day. By having some experience. I learn by my mistakes. Oh, what caused that. The light comes. I say okay. I need to apply the cross to that. I expect to be a learner until the end. 

[B] The Spirit is the unique, all-inclusive blessing. Saints 65 and other. Could you come to the platform and for two minutes share your experiences of receiving the all-inclusive blessing of the Spirit. I have been learning I cannot live without God's blessing. I cannot serve, cannot be a wife or a husband.  This is really true. An all-inclusive blessing. Our God is a God of blessing. He would like to bless all of us. 

[C] receive transmission and supply. Christ is in the heavens with a heavenly ministry. Dispensing the heavenly things into us that we have live a heavenly life on earth. The high priest in the heavenlies is praying for us, ministering to us and flowing into us, so that while we are living on the earth we are living with a supply from the heavens. So while we are living an earthly life we are simultaneously living a heavenly life.

[D] God's organic salvation. His saving us in life takes place only when we are in the divine and mystical realm. Lord, show me where I am in the growth in life. 

[E] divine species. Outwardly, apparently we are the same as everyone around, but inwardly we are another species.

[F] fellowship in light, blood of Jesus cleansing us from every sin.

[G] spontaneous and effortless life by the automatic function of the law of life. It's just happening because it's the law of life operating in you.

[H] truthfulness, divine reality. 2 John 1, 3 John 1. Revealed divine reality becoming our genuineness and sincerity we may live a life that corresponds to the light. Even at work or school or a mother with children contacting other women. Eventually they realise, there's something different about you. They sense something. Would you like to know? That is, the divine reality is being wrought into me day by day by the spirit of reality who is guiding all of the believers into the reality making me genuine, sincere.

Some trainees ask what br Lee was like. He was the most human, Jesusly human person, I've ever known. He was genuine, truthful, sincere. No politics, no diplomacy. What a corporate life is this? There's nothing false.

[I] keeping of oneness. The real oneness is in the Triune God.

## VI. Every believer should live in the divine and mystical realm and be a divine and mystical person, one who is human yet lives divinely

You have to be human, but live divinely. 

[A] everything in out living should be divine and mystical. I got up in the morning and told my wife my ears are blocked. Ear wax. I went to urgent care. I got in, sitting on the table. A young doctor came and for half an hour he was doing many things. While i was there I was living in the divine and mystical realm. They sense something. My wife was with me. We gave them a brief gospel word. Everything in our daily living should be divine and mystical. If you're driving and there are eight cars in front of you. An opportunity. Live in the divine and mystical realm at the red arrow. Little things like this will happen endlessly. No matter what we go through we will be living in the divine and mystical realm.

[B] everything with God, by God, in God, through God. Certain matter just have to be taken care of. Maybe the Lord will say, what you did is correct, but the way you did it was not correct. It was you being righteous. This is an enlightening point. Doing everything with God, in God, by God, through God.

[C] living simultaneously in the physical realm and in the divine and mystical realm. This is what the Lord wants to produce in all of us. 

## VII. At that time two men will be in the field, one is taken and one is left; two women will be grinding at the mill. One is taken and one is left.

In Revelation, for the living ones to be raptured they must be matured. 

[A] They are believers. The brothers will be living a daily life, the sisters doing the same. The Lord will come secretly. Some are taken. Some that we thought would be left behind. 

[B] secret rapture. ready, mature ones. If you haven't lived in the divine and mystical realm enough you will be left behind. The difference is the maturity of life. One is living in the realm and one is not. Both living a normal human life, male and female. One of the brothers and one of the sisters, living simultaneously in the divine and mystical realm. 

1 John 2:28, now little children, abide in Him, so that is He is manifested we may have boldness and not be put to shame from Him at His coming.

You may be mature, but where will you be when the Lord comes? Will you be in this realm? The anointing teaches us to abide in Him. Then when the Lord comes to rapture we will not only be mature but also on the alert.
