## Message 4 Testing

### 1. What is the literal meaning of blended? What are the practical implications of blending?

Literal meanings:

1. adjusted - as a carpenter cutting the wood to size
2. harmonised - as instruments in an orchestra
3. tempered - as iron put in fire and water to strengthen it
4. mingled - as a branch grafted into another tree

Practical implications:

1. stop to have fellowship - willing to stop, hand ourselves over. covering, balancing
2. do nothing without fellowship - out of our self, seclusion, peculiarity
3. be touched and touch others - not political. through the cross, by the Spirit, dispensing Christ
4. blending of Christ - not social, must be our enjoyment of Christ

### 2. Use John 12:24 and 1 Corinthians 10:17a to show the need and significance of blending.

**John 12:24**

> Truly, truly, I say to you, Unless the grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit

Grains are for making bread. By themselves grains are no good. This means we cannot be individualistic.

To be made one bread grains need to be broken and then blended together. Cannot remain whole and separate.



**1 Corinthians 10:17a**

> Seeing that there is one bread, we who are many are one Body; for we all partake of the one bread.

This thought is taken from the meal offering in Leviticus 2:1-16

The meal offering requires oil to blend the fine flour. This shows our blending must have the Spirit.

A loaf is for nourishing other people. When we are blending together as a proper church life, those who come into our midst will be nourished.

### 3. Show the relationship between being in the local churches and having the reality of the Body of Christ. How can blending facilitate out arriving at the goal of the reality of the Body of Christ?

Relationship:

- the local churches are the procedure to be brought into the reality of the Body of Christ
- like a vehicle that gets us to our destination. The vehicle might be nice, but we don't stay in it once we arrive.
- the Body is like the highest peak of a mountain; the local churches are at the foothills.

Blending to facilitate arriving at the goal:

- blending brings us to Christ as our reality, not just outward practices
- blending goes beyond the limitation of locality and gives us a concern for the members all over the earth
- blending removes the isolation of local churches
- blending causes us to go by the cross and through the Spirit, resulting in a change in our inward being

### 4. Explain what it means to have a corporate living by the perfected God-men. What does it mean to be perfected in this case?

A corporate living of perfected God-men means men who are living not by their own life but by God.

To be perfected means to be mature and to live the life Jesus lived when He was on the earth.

- 2 Cor. 13:11 `be perfected ... think the same thing, be at peace` - to be perfected is related to thinking the same thing and being at peace. this is to be **blending together in our mind**, our thinking, by having the mind of Christ who humbled Himself
- Eph. 4:12 `for the perfecting of the saints ... unto the building up of the Body of Christ` - perfecting is **unto the building up of the Body**, also the goal of blending.
- 1 Pet.5:10 `God ... after you have suffered a little while, will Himself perfect, establish, strengthen and ground you.` - perfecting comes from suffering, which must be **through the cross** so that Christ can work Himself into our being.
- 1 John 4:12 `if we love one another ... His love is perfected in us` - perfecting comes from loving one another. this is to be **blended together in our emotion** by taking Christ as our love.
- 1 John 4:17 `in this has love been perfect with us ... because even as He is, so also are we in this world` - perfecting results in us **being the same as He is** in our living in this world.

### 5. How do we experience a mingling living with the Triune God to issue in the reality of the Body of Christ?

- being full of oil, not reigning it over our brothers (Judg. 9:9)
- being conformed to the death of Christ in the power of His resurrection (Phil. 3:10)
- enjoying Christ as the resurrection life (John 11:25)
- opening our "gates" to the King of glory to come in (Psa. 24:7, 9)
