# Message Three - God building Himself in Christ into our being

All the twelve points (of this training) are needed for the preparation of the Bride, for the bringing about of the holy city New Jerusalem. These things cannot be brought in without us entering into their reality. Not mere comprehension, entrance into the experience of these things. This is a unique training. I was reminded of this word in Matt. 13, the mysteries of the kingdom. Between the matter of the seed and His expounding of it, the Lord spent quite a few verses concerning these mysteries about which He was speaking; how important it it for us to see them, hear them and understand them with our heart. The heart of the people listening was fat, their ears heavy, their eyes closed. Blest are your eyes because they see and your ears because they hear. For truly I say to you that many prophets and righteous men had desired to perceive the things that you perceive and have not perceived them. I don't know how you feel. I feel these words, these outlines, these points, these must be the very things that many prophets and righteous men have desired to perceive. But they have never had the opportunity to do so. They were not blessed like we are today. I am a blessed man. I feel all of you are blessed. Even the fact that we can, perhaps not fully understand, but even hear, isn't that a blessing? Recently there was a survey, asked people what is your top question if you have one. All kinds of crazy questions. The top among them are, what am I? what's the meaning of my life? who is God? why is there evil in the world? Are we okay? These are what we would call existential questions. All these twelve messages answer all those questions. Not in a superficial way as many would try to answer these questions. The answer is all here. But it took 500 years of the recovery for God's people to be brought to this high point. To understand and answer these questions in the deepest manner. In a Biblical manner. This kind of answer must come from only one source and that is God Himself. I hope you would all be in awe of these things. Mesmerised by these things. Never, for the rest of our lives, treat any of these twelve matters in a light way.

Central matter of God's eternal economy - God's intention and desire, to build Himself in Christ into our being. The word **build** is important. This is the work of God. Dispense, build, constitute. This word build is inclusive. This building, as a process, covers the entire organic salvation of God. Starting from regeneration, onto sanctification, onto renewal, onto transformation, conformation, glorification. That's God's building work as a process. It takes all these steps of His full salvation that He has ordained for you and I to completely build Himself into our entire being. It started when we were saved. Since then it has been going on. Eventually we would be the fulness of Christ. Those who reflect Christ and express Christ. We will become Christ in a proper sense. Ultimately it is God's intent and pleasure that Christ would be all to me. This Christ will then fill all and in all. The church is just Christ taking over, filling, saturating, become a group of people. They becoming what He is.

**2 Samuel 7:12-14a** will make this matter a little more clear. Br Lee in LS in 1993 gave seven messages on this passage. Spending all that time just on this prophecy. A prophecy through typology. How God's intention is to build Christ into our constitution.

> When your days are fulfilled and you sleep with your fathers I will raise up your seed after you. Which will come forth from your body and I will establish his kingdom. It is he who will build a house for my name and I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever. I will be his father and he will be my son.

Something more intrinsic in the heart of God. This seed is actually not Solomon in fulfillment. David's seed is actually Christ as God's firstborn Son, who has both divinity and humanity. Typified by Solomon. The Son of God became David's seed by being built into David's family. God is telling David that instead of him (David) building the house for God, David actually needed God to build His Son into him. God didn't want an outward house. God was not satisfied with David having such a heart. Not satisfied that David would merely be a man according to God's heart. His desire was to work Himself in Christ, into David's humanity to be his life, nature and constitution. In this way Christ the Son of God would become everything to David, including His house and seed. 

There is no need for us to build something for God. We cannot build God's house the church by using ourselves as the material. The church as the house of God is built with Christ as the unique element. Anything that is not Christ has no part in the church. The building of the church is by Christ making His home in our hearts. Have you ever associated Ephesians 3 about the father strengthening us into the inner man so that Christ would make His home in our hearts, that making His home in our heart is the building of the church. Making our heart, our intrinsic constitution His home. It is a serious matter, whether we let Christ make His home in our hearts or not.

*It is He* - Christ is the one who actually builds the church. In reality Christ is also the element with which the church is built. He is not only the builder, He is the builded One. As the seed Christ is the one who builds. As the house He is the One who got built, not only in Himself but in you and me. When you say God is building Himself into us you can also say God is mingling Himself with us. This is all God is doing. Building, mingling, incorporating us one into another. A mutual abode. The same abode, but the abode for He and us. As the abode of God NJ is the tabernacle, as our above it is the temple.

*He will be my son* - In resurrection Christ became the life-giving Spirit. The human seeds become the sons of God with divinity. 

Don't say this is impossible. We should know this so we can enter into these things. Every day He is building some more into our being.

## I. Second Samuel 7:2-14a is the unveiling of a prophecy through typology showing us that we need God to build Christ into our intrinsic constitution so that our entire being will be reconstituted with Christ

Every day we need to 'let', open our being, especially our heart. To let Him do this building work.

[A]  How can we become part of this? It is through this organic salvation that Christ will work Christ into our being. Transformation is not to be a 'better brother', it is to make me part of the building.

[B] Nothing in us good for God's building. The only way for us to become part of this building is for us to digest, assimilate Christ. He is food, drink and breath to us. After the food is broken down in us it becomes the building blocks for new cells and repairing cells. This is for our body's survival. Metabolism. Here br Lee stressed, there is a metabolic process as we eat Christ, breath Christ, drink Christ, there is a complicated process happening. An assimilation through digestion. A reception of all this food. 

The private moments in the inner chambers where we are alone with the Lord, where He speaks and shines, when we pray to Him and deal with Him, by His Spirit and Word, there is a process going on called digestion, assimilation. In these dealings we have with Him. I hope our personal life with the Lord would be deepened and strengthened.

## II. The believers, who have been regenerated in Christ with God's life, are God's cultivated land, a farm in God's new creation to grow Christ that previous materials may be produced for God's building

[A] Growth equals building.

[B] Not only Christ as the element but something on our side as the material.

[C] the seed is a composition of elements from both the seed and the soil. human spirit and human nutrients with human heart as human soil to be the nutrients. God is the element and we afford the nutrients.

Relationship between seed and soil.  The seed is the seed of life, Christ Himself. Incorruptible seed in 1 Pet 1. The word holds a kernel, something inside which is the life of God. In this seed is everything needed to reproduce itself. The life, the shape form. All the genetic material is all there. It has nothing to do with the soil. God's genes are all in the seed. But it needs to be sown into the soil. This soil is the human soil, the human heart. In this heart with the spirit as the hidden man of the heart, you have something human. A human spirit and a human heart. The seed was sown into our spirit. To mingle with our spirit. This Christ is not a simple Christ. All the divine things even humanity, all the unsearchable riches are in this seed. This seed is dropped into our spirit. Out spirit has this seed in it. The spirit of ours is in the soil, the human heart. For a seed to break down and germinate it needs the soil. The soil supply nutrients, to supply oxygen, moisture and water. These things the soil supplies will cause this chemical reaction to place for the seed to germinate, to send roots down, sprout, grow and produce fruit. The soil supplies certain materials. It is not the fallen heart. It is that part that has this spirit in it with these riches of Christ. What d we need to do? We need to enjoy this Christ in our spirit. Be filled in this spirit. Also let these riches spill over, to spread into our heart. So something resurrected, uplifted, in the human heart. We need to deal with our heart, not only to clear away the rocks, stones, thorns, but to have a heart that has Christ in it. All these things of Christ will supply the seed of Christ for the seed to grow. This building work requires our cooperation. He is the primary element, but we need to supply some material for that building. 

## III. The apostle's prayer in Ephesians 3 reveals that for the fulfillment of God's eternal economy, we need the Father, according to the riches of His glory, to strengthen us with power through His Spirit into the inner man, that Christ may build Himself into our hearts, occupying our entire being, that we might be filled unto all the fullness of God.

Let Him come deep down into all the parts of our heart. Right now the New Jerusalem is being built. If our hearts are open, in this moment and day by day, NJ is being built. In all dimensions.

## IV. If we realise that God desires to work Himself into His chosen people, then the goal of our work will be to minister the building and builded God into others so that the Triune God may build Himself into our being. 

[B] How much of Christ has been wrought into those whom we have saved?

[G] Our work must be part of this mutual constitution. Let everyone take heed with what material he builds with. One will be built, the other will endure as part of the NJ.

[I] Are we really building up the NJ today, or just something according to our interest and preference?

## V. Eventually, the Triune God and redeemed humanity will be mingled, blended, and built up as one entity - the New Jerusalem
