We are all so blessed to hear these things, see these things and speak these things. I don't believe in history there has been a people like us, still seeking the Lord and what's on His heart. Even in the apostle's time, it was among a small number of believers in a small area. But today the Lord's recovery has propagated to all six continents of the earth. The ministry has reached to such an extent. These twelve crystals should be like twelve shining floodlights shining over the path until the Lord's appearing. I don't believe there are any other teachings or doctrines that we need to be worrying about. The Lord's recovery is not something that just happened yesterday. Since Martin Luther took a major step and since brother Nee was raised up just over a hundred years ago. The Lord has been climbing this mountain and brought us to this highest peak. We have landed here with these twelve huge crystals. Crystallising the Lord's central burden, the present truth we need to keep, practice and live by for the rest of our days. It's not we don't know the other basic fundamental truths. We are living in the 21st century and very close to the Lord's soon appearing. There is really nothing else to live for, but to remain in what the Lord has presented to us. These twelve messages can be easily unpacked to become 144 messages or even more. Don't worry about whether you understand these things now or not. Keep them in your heart. 

Many mature brothers have gone to be the Lord. They are constituted with these things and one by one they are going to be the Lord. Many younger ones are rising up, still here, continuing in the Lord's recovery. This is not a small thing to me. This training is not just a review of some past messages. We are here affirming these crystallised speaking of the Lord. This is the Lord's present truth. This is His up to date speaking, His central burden. Also a kind of passing on of a baton to a younger generation. Many younger brothers and sisters, take this and run with this. Whether many of us older ones will meet the Lord alive we don't know, but many younger ones will. Praise the Lord. I've been in the Lord's recovery for 57 years. I have not regretted one day of being here. Every day I'm so thankful the Lord has kept me. If I have another life, I'd like to give it to the Lord. It's worth every thing. There's nothing else on this earth worth living for. We have to do our duty, take care of our regular human life, but there is another realm. This is how we are going to live our days.

# Message Four - Blending and the reality of the Body of Christ

Apparently these two matters are separate, but actually the blending is for the reality and the reality is the issue of the blending. This word 'blending' has been used frequently and commonly used among us. I'm concerned we have not gotten into what blending means. In the world people also promote blending. Go abroad, study different cultures. But that is far from what was revealed in the word concerning blending. Brother Lee used the word in a more general way concerning fellowship. But not until he came to the matter of the vital groups that he came to the matter of blending in a more specific way. To carry out the vital groups, we need blending for the vitality. The blending vitalises us. We were all scattered in our own realm and sphere. We struggle, try to do this and that. As long as we are scattered we will never be vitalised. So in the vital group fellowship he stressed the matter of blending very much. Then in 1993 he did something unprecedented. He gathered the churches in southern California to have a blending conference. In that weekend there were seven messages brother Lee spoke, but not just by himself, but along with 47 other brothers. He took lead to open up four of the messages and then the other brothers followed. It was an unprecedented event. A year later in 1994 he released 'the practical points concerning blending'. Many who attended got more confused. This blending has to be practiced. But in order to be practised you need to see the purpose. If you don't see the blending in the most thorough way, if you just try to practice in an outward way, it will be something outward, something social. A new unveiling concerning the matter of blending. And it can be practised if you are willing and open to have your concepts removed. Not according to your natural concept. I hope some seed can be sown into us to realise blending is much more than just getting together, see some new faces. That has not touched the depth of blending.

Then what is it?

## I. God has blended the Body together

When we use this word it is mostly in the realm of socialising. But when Paul uses the word in 1 Cor. 12, he is talking about the blending of the Body. In 1 Cor 12 in the body there are many members. Some are more comely and stronger, and others the opposite. The eye cannot say, I don't need the feet. The ear cannot say I'm not the eye, I'm not of the body. The feet are in the lowest places, I'm not as high as the eyes, I don't belong to the body. No. Even the members who are less comely need more comeliness. v 23, these we cloth with more abundant honour. v24 God has blended the body together, v25 that there would be no division in the body. This matter of blending is in relation to how we care for one another in the body. The result should be that there be no division in the body. Blending keeps us from having division. In blending is the adjustment, love, care, that will save us from any despising, uplifting. Blending saves us from any kind of division. No ground for division.

[A] high, deep and mysterious. our kind of blending is shallow. why is it mysterious? look at your body. in our human body we have so many parts with different functions. different degrees of importance. the body adjusts itself. when your little toe gets stepped on it hurts. the whole body goes to it to cherish it, care for it. not by arrangement. but something in the body causes a kind of balance, a kind of care. the blending is something high and deep and mysterious.

[B] adjusted, harmonised , tempered, mingled, losing of distinction. **adjusted**. Carpenter building furniture. wood too long needs to be adjusted. **harmonised** like music. orchestra. if each player plays their own note it will be ugly. when everyone is harmonised the music will be beautiful. **tempered**. smith put iron in hot fire and water to strengthen the steel. blending is a kind of tempering. **mingling**. hybrid fruit, enrichment of species. If we do not have blending we will be odd.

[C] stop to have fellowship. when we are burdened to do something. fellowship is to open yourselves to others, not merely tell others what you are doing. be willing to stop. seek fellowship with others. otherwise we just do things according to our own desire or the outward needs. no covering, no balance. no blessing. blending demands we would be willing to stop and open ourselves to fellowship with other members.

[D] do nothing without fellowship with other saints whom we are coordinating with. I long for fellowship in spirit. We cannot have genuine blending without fellowship. but to have genuine fellowship we need to come out of our self, our seclusion, our peculiarity. We are so isolated, so secluded. we justify ourselves by the things we do. we are like a castle with a strong thick wall protecting ourselves not letting anyone touch ourselves.

[E] touched by others and touching others. we can have genuine and transparent fellowship. if you see I have some shortages in what I just said, you would be able in the lord's love to touch me. it's not outward rebuking by your natural self but in the spirit by the lord's love you can touch others and are willing to be touched. openness and willingness. otherwise we are very political. speak nice words to each other. pat each other on the back. not the genuine transparent fellowship. 1) through the cross, 2) by the Spirit, 3) to dispense Christ. In your blending is there any cutting of the cross? Any exercise of the spirit? Any ministering of Christ? salt, oil, frankincense, fine flour. in that type we see what the genuine blending is. there has to be these elements.

[F] blending of the Christ we enjoy and partake of. when we come together not just how are you, but genuine concern. not just about your own welfare. full of the feeling.

[G] for the body to be kept in oneness we need the blending. Col. Let the Laodiceans read this epistle and you also read the epistle I wrote to Laodecia. Nothing secret. We should have more blending. We have thousands and thousands of churches. we don't blend enough. we don't have much concern, sensitivity, consciousness of each other. not much care. as long as *my* church is doing okay. As long as *my* area in the work is doing fine. br Lee said we don't know how much we need blending. now nearly 30 years since that time. I don't know how much we have advanced. we have many more churches and conferences. but unless we touch the matter of blending to this depth we are still isolated. as long as I'm doing okay, my church is doing fine, saints, we are all together as one loaf. the Lord has wiped out on the boundaries and localities. all the regions are learning to be blended together. No need to be afraid, I'm trespassing in your church.  some coworkers tried to emphasise, don't trespass my area, my church. where is the cross, the spirit, the blending of the body?

## II. John 12:24 and 1 Corinthians 1017a portray and reveal the necessity and the significance of blending

[A] grain of wheat falls into the ground to make many grains. We are the many grains. But grains by themselves are no good. The grains are for the purpose of making a loaf that is nourishing to people. Ground and blended together. Christ as the unique grain was buried and produced many grains. In His resurrection put these grains together and blended to produce on loaf, the church. God's desire is not to have grains, but to have a loaf, a meal offering.

[B] type of meal offering. flour mingled with oil. when we come together, where is the Spirit? The fine flour needs to be mingled with oil.

issue in a totality, the church life as a corporate meal offering. Individual Christ is for our nourishment. But the corporate Christ. when there's the blending the church life will be so nourishing to people.

## III. The purpose of the blending is to usher us all into the reality of the Body of Christ

Purpose is not to meet new people or new locality. Purpose is to usher us into the reality of the Body of Christ. What is the reality of the Body of Christ. The Body of Christ is the church. But not just in a physical sense. Meetings, services, functions. When we talk about a local church we talk about the physical aspects. But the Body of Christ refers to the very life in the church. Without that life the church would just be a shell. The reality of the Body of Christ. Not the practicality, many things we carry out. that which is real. as a human being is his reality how he dresses and how he looks? the physical body is just a shell. the reality is not what is outside but what is inside. after a person dies a dead body is lying there. everything is outwardly there but not a living body. that is a corpse. today, is our church a carcass? Just the form, the meetings and arrangements? Or is there the life that makes this person a real person? we have thousands and thousands of churches. If there are 1500 churches on the earth, is it enough? They may be 1500 separated isolated churches. Br Lee saw churches but asked where is the reality of the body of Christ. We need the blending. the purpose of the blending is to usher us into the reality of the body of Christ.

[A] need to be in local churches as procedure. Love to be here, but just a procedure. don't treasure your local church that much. the local arrangements might change but the body doesn't change. you are still living in the body. not to belittle or despise the local churches. but the local churches we love are a procedure, a vehicle, to bring us to our goal, our destination. to travel from point A to B so you drive a car to arrive there. It's a nice car. But after you arrive at your destination don't stay in your car. This car is just to transport you to your destination. The reality of the body of Christ is the goal. we need the local churches to train us to live in the body. a procedure to learn how to blended with the ones next to you. If you can, you will be prepared to be blended with the saints all over the earth.

[B] LR is like a mountain. we are arriving at the highest peak. we have been travel, among us over a hundred years. now we are arriving at this high peak. the lord needs this high peak. at the foothill we are brought to the local churches. as we started climbing we see what the Lord wants. The Lord desires to have the reality of the body of Christ.

[C] if you do not have the experiences of Christ in his death and resurrection, remaining in your shell, your seclusion you are not in the reality of the body.

[D] urgently needs the reality of the body to be expressed in the local churches. w/o substantial expression the Lord will not return. there have been many churches all over the earth. But the Lord still cannot return until there is a substantial expression of the reality of the body of Christ.

## IV. The highest peak in God's economy is the reality of the Body of Christ

God's economy has a peak. His becoming man, with many wonderful processes. But there is a goal. The reality of the Body of Christ.

[A] significance of blending is the reality of the Body of Christ. having the experience of passing through the cross, dispensing Christ, that is the reality of the Body of Christ. Men who have been made God in life and nature. Live by an
