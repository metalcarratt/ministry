# An overview of the central burden and present truth of the Lord's recovery before His appearing



S.S. Be like a gazelle or young heart upon the mountain of spices

A prayer for the Lord's coming in the power of His resurrection to set up His sweet and beautiful kingdom on the earth. I love the way this romance ends. Br. Nee's exposition of S.S, he said, our life depends on the Lord's words, and our work depends on His commands. If we don't have His speaking we have no life, if we have no commands we have no service. The life of the believers hinges totally on the Lord's speaking.

**"present truth"** - 2 Pet. 1:12. The up to date truth. He has been recovering item after item progressively. Beginning with justification by faith He has been going on and on. We believe that all of these twelve messages are the up to date truth, the present truth, that will bring the Lord back. I would encourage you just to peruse through the titles of these twelve messages. If you start with the winter training in 1993 to 1997. All these twelve items come from those years. It is really amazing that at the end of our brother's ministry, the Lord gave him these items. These are what the Lord showed our brother at the end of his course.  

A word of love

> I am concerned for the Lord's recovery. Nothing else is on my heart. ... 

Ch 17 of the vital groups. I edited this book. Br Lee gave three different trainings. The final training is called the vital groups. He felt that was the highest training he gave. A br pointed out to me, there are 16 messages. In collected works is ch 17. All that's there is an outline. How to help those who we contact to grow in life, not with doctrine but with speaking the high truths. Ten of these items. We added two (shepherding according to God and becoming the NJ). "flowing up into eternal life". We have to be careful. When we take care of new ones we need to be careful, but brother Lee says we need to help these ones to grow in life with these things. truth is different from doctrines. Truth is the divine light shining on the words of the Bible and televising a divine vision. We don't want to water this down. This is who we are. Br Lee was concerned that we would build a bridge back to Christianity. we love all the Christians but we don't want to build a bridge back. we want to increase, but we don't want to sacrifice the truth because of the increase. These things are not too high for the new ones. The problem isn't with them, the problem is with you. You can't speak these things. If we speak these things properly we can back anyone see these things. We had two brothers come in to the church, both mechanics, they came right in when br Lee was releasing these things. They just saw it like that. We talk about deification. He talks about a glass of hot water and put a tea bag in the hot water the water becomes tea. It gets teaified. When the water is teaified it becomes tea in taste but not tea in the teabag. We don't become part of the Godhead. That's in-communicable. But we do become the same as God in life and nature. When the divine and mystical teabag comes into us, the stirring starts.

# Message One - The ultimate goal of God's economy - God became man that man might become God in life and nature but not in the Godhead for the building up of the Body of Christ to consummate the New Jerusalem

## I. The "diamond" in the "box" of the Bible is the revelation that in Christ God has become man in order that man might become God in life and nature but not in the Godhead for the building up of the Body of Christ to consummate the New Jerusalem

When br Lee began to speak on this there was a lot of opposition. Some of us brothers wrote a small booklet. Br Lee commissioned Ron and I to go to the Philippines because that's where a lot of opposition was coming out. We were ecstatic. When we looked at the Bible we saw deification everywhere. The saints fully received this revelation. They were fully innoculated. 

[C] God did not create mankind. He created man according to *His* kind. God created things according to their kind. The word 'kind' in Genesis is a synonym for species. God did not create man according to man's kind. Let us create man according to our likeness. Quite marvellous. 

[D] In resurrection Christ created a new kind. God-man kind. A new species. Gal. 4:6. We are His sons. Abba Father. God is our father. We have His life, His nature. Isa. 64:8. Jehovah, You are our father. We are the clay and you are our potter. Our father is our potter. Isa 1:2, God's love toward Israel is exercise in three ways, as a father, as a nursing mother, as a husband. Paul said we were gently in your midst as a nursing mother. Isa. 66:13, bounces us on the knee. I have sons. I'm the father. They can't become Marks the father. But I have sons. They are Marks the sons. They are on the same level as me, the same kind as me, the same category as me. But they don't participate in my fatherhood.

## II. The most marvellous, excellent, mysterious, and all-inclusive transformations of the eternal and Triune God in His becoming a man are God's move in man for the accomplishment of His eternal economy

Synonym for transformations is processes. God rules sovereignly over the earth with His authority that the earth might be fit for His chosen people to receive salvation. The Lord arranges the environment as the ruler, the leader. If you consider, the Lord went to a lot of trouble to get us saved. To get us into the church life. To get us into this room. Tis mercy all. 

[A] contactable. touchable. We can touch Him right now. Receivable. Experientable. He's enterable. He's enjoyable.

[B] "cords of a man" - His love is divine but for His love to reach us He had to become a man, so He loves us on the level of humanity. Through Christ's humanity. The cords are the transformations, processes - incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, ascension. Through these God reaches us. I have drawn you with lovingkindness. SS1:4, Lord draw me. We need to pray that every day. Lord, draw me. 1 Cor 13:8 love never falls away.

[C] From ancient times the Triune God was preparing to come into humanity. His goings forth are from ancient times, from the days of eternity. He is still going forth. 

## III. Our becoming God in life and nature but not in the Godhead was initiated by God the Father in eternity past by His choosing us to be holy, predestinating us unto sonship; the divine sanctification for the divine sonship is the center of the divine economy and the central thought of the revelation in the New Testament.

In eternity past when God chose us and predestinated us He predestinated us to become God in life and nature.

[B] Only God is holy. For Him to **choose us to be holy** is to choose us to become God because only God is holy. You shall be holy because I am holy. You shall be Me in all your manner of life.

[C] You can't be a son if you don't have the Father's life. In eternity past He **predestinated us to be His sons** and to have His life. He predetermined our destiny. To become Him in life and in nature. Do you see this? We are being sonized by God.

To be holy is the process, the be sons is the goal.

## IV. The divine sanctification is the holding line in the carrying out of the divine economy to sonize us divinely, making us sons of God in His life and nature (but not in the Godhead) so that we may be God's expression; hence, God's sanctification is the divine sonizing.

He is making us holy, sanctifying us in our entire tripartite being until we become the holy city, New Jerusalem.

[B] Luke 15, lost sheep, lost coin, lost son. The lost coin has to do with God the Spirit as the sanctifying Spirit, causing us to come to our senses, separating us unto Himself. His seeking sanctification. The Spirit is signified by a woman with a broom. She has ten silver coins. If she looses one she lights a lamp and sweeps in the room and seeks carefully until she finds it. Isn't that what happened to you? The Spirit did a lot of sweeping. "he came to himself". That is the result of the Spirit's seeking sanctification. 

Every step of God's move is really to sanctify us because to sanctify us is to sonize us.

[E] Rom. 6:4, walk in newness of life. 6:7, serve in newness of spirit. LS of 1 and 2 Samuel. The stale Aaronic priesthood. At the time the Aaronic priesthood had become stale. When I was in Russia I remember I would pick up a piece of bread, there was no way I would try to eat that bread. If I threw that at your head it would knock you out. We don't want to be stale. Don't you want to be fresh, new, active?

 ## V. The divine, dispositional sanctification is carried out by Christ as the life-giving, sanctifying and speaking Spirit.

Aren't you glad the Spirit is the speaking Spirit.

[A] Cleansing by the washing of the water in the word. v25 bride redemption, v27 bride presentation. v26 is the key to bring the Lord back. "Lord, keep me in the washing process."

[B] we need the laver. wash away all your earthly defilement before you can touch anything in the tabernacle. Morning and evening we need to come to the Bible and be cleansed by the laver in the word. Is the Lord speaking to me *now*. Is the Lord speaking to me *today*?

[D] Man shall not live on bread alone but on every rhema that proceeds out of the word of God. The Lord was saying, this is what I live by. The Lord always said to the devil he said It is written. All His quotes were from the book of Deuteronomy. He converted the logos to rhema. He told the devil *man* shall not live on bread alone but on every *rhema* that proceeds out through the word of God. The flesh profits nothing, the rhema-plural, they are spirit and life. Rhema is His word with out name on it. "this is my word to you." We need to convert this logos to rhema every day. That's why we pray-read the word, especially our personal pray-reading. We need to converse using these words. Lord speak to me today. I need more spirit, more life. This is personal.

[E] The laver of bronze was a mirror that could reflect and expose. when you come to the word many times you are shined on, exposed. oh lord forgive me. we can't take a vacation from our spirit. Keep us in our spirit. Is God speaking His word to me today?

[F] Today. He didn't care about yesterday or the future. He only cares about today. Is the Lord speaking to us today?

[H] the Lord's presence is one with His speaking. Christ's speaking is the very presence of the life-giving Spirit. When He speaks to you you have His smile. 

## VI. Our being sanctified for the divine sonship ultimately consummates in the New Jerusalem as the holy city and the aggregate of the divine sonship. this is the ultimate consummation of God become man in the flesh that man might become God in the Spirit to gain a corporate, great God-man for the corporate expression, the glory of the Triune God.
