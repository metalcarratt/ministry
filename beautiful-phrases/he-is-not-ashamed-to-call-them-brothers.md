Heb. 2:11b
> For which cause He is not ashamed to all them brothers

Heb. 2:12
> Saying, "I will declare Your name to my brothers; in the midst of the church I will sing hymns of praise to You."

Heb. 2:14a
> Since therefore the children have shared in blood and flesh, He also Himself in like manner partook of the same

Jesus is the Firstborn Son of God. As the Only-begotten Son of God, He has the divine nature, but as the Firstborn Son of God He has both the divine nature and the human nature. He partook of the human nature and has given us
to partake of the divine nature that He and we could become the same. Now He is the Firstborn Son and we are the many sons. We are all genuine sons of God, because we have the divine nature. This makes God our Father. Jesus can
call us His brothers because we have the same life as Him, and we can call God our Father because we have the same life as Him.

Now, in the church, the Firstborn Son is singing hymns of praise to the Father. Whenever we sings hymns of praise to the Father, the Lord our Brother, sings in our singing. Do you want to gain more of the Firstborn Son of God?
Then praise the Father! When we praise the Father, Jesus  as the Firstborn Son of God joins in. In this way we enjoy not only God as our Father, but Jesus as the Firstborn being one with us.
