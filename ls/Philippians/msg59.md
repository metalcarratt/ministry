forbearance requires us to rejoice in the lord. it also requires us to have learned the secret of sufficieny. also requires understanding of others and their situation (wisdom). it needs us to pray much to know how to speak.

forbearance is necessary because we are bound together permanently, in our married life, family life and church life.
