thinking blossomed anew shows that fellowship for furtherance of the h
gospel is a matter of life.

philippians opened a heavenly bank account. if we deposit into the account by giving the lord will also deposit by receiving. what he gives is much more than what we give, but if we are greedy he may wait to repay us even until the next age.
the lords giving to us is in glory and in the Lord Jesus.
