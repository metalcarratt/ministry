four items - salvation, grace, spirit and christ. paul does not deal with these
items in a doctrinal way but in an experiential way.

salvation is needed from multiple things. not only salvation from hell. paul needed
salvation in prison. not release from prison but salvation from being put to shame or
not magnifying christ.

grace is the triune god as our enjoyment. god has been processed so that we can enjoy him.
