pt1
four items - salvation, grace, spirit and christ. paul does not deal with these
items in a doctrinal way but in an experiential way.

salvation is needed from multiple things. not only salvation from hell. paul needed
salvation in prison. not release from prison but salvation from being put to shame or
not magnifying christ.

grace is the triune god as our enjoyment. god has been processed so that we can enjoy him.

pt2
we experience christ as our grace in our Christian and church life. Paul's situation was much worse than us. he was in prison. he was a patriotic jew who hated the Roman's but he had been imprisoned by them because of his own countrymen. he was also imprisoned because of his defence and confirmation of the gospel. also once he was in prison many were happy and disrupted his work. nevertheless, he was rejoicing in that situation, not weeping. weeping would have indicated defeat. only rejoicing when the ministry is going well is not victory.

to be our grace in such a way, christ has to be the spirit. it is by exercising our spirit and calling on the lord that we can enjoy grace in this way.
