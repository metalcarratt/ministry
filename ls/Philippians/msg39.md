some say it is heresy to say god can live in us, but this is what the bible says.
the bible not only says god abides in us but that he lives in us. to abide is just
to stay somewhere, like in a hotel, but to live is to be at home, to have full right
to do whatever we want there.

we need to give the lord the opportunity to move into our mind, emotion and will, not
just remain in our spirit. because this is not easy paul prayed for us to be strengthened
into our inner man.

eventually we will be constituted of christ. this is like the saying, you are what you eat.
