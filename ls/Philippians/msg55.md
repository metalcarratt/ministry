christ is the out resurrection. as the out resurrection he is the way for us to
walk the christian life, which means to have a christian life of constantly putting
off the old creation (signified by the clothes Jesus left in the tomb when he
resurrected) and putting on the new creation, christ as the out resurrection.

we need to have one mind to have this kind of walk. Christians today have many
kinds of minds such as teachings on ethics. we should not be broad minded in this matter but narrow. there is
only one way for us to take in the lords recovery, the narrow way, which is the way
of the out resurrection. it is hard for Christians to have one mind.

wherunto we have attained by the same rule let us walk. this means, regardless of our spiritual
experience, there is only one way for us to walk. this walk is stoicheo, the military
walk. it is to walk according to rules. by having the one mind we can have the one walk
as if in military rank.
