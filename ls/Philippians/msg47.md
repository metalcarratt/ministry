we need a daily salvation. phil 1.19, paul needed salvation from being put to shame
and to magnify christ in his imprisonment. that was a particular person in a 
particular situation. phil 2:12 we need salvation from murmurings and reasonings,
crookedness and perverseness to hold forth the word of life to share to those we
meet around us in our daily life. this is ordinary people in a common situation. thus
whether our situation is particular or common, we need this salvation every day.
