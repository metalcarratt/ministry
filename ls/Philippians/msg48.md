we need a practical daily salvation. paul was in a prison and needed a salvation
more practical than eternal salvation. the practical, constant salvation saves
from being put to shame, and from murmurings, reasonigmngs, crookedness, peverseness,
etc.
salvation needs a power to save us, and this power is the bountiful supply of the
spirit of jesus christ and the indwelling god. god is not just visiting but indwelling.
