five aspects of the rich provision to enjoy constant salvation:
- the pattern and standard of the lord in lowering himself, humbling himself, becoming obedient unto death, which we must follow
- inner operating god, who works together with us like in a three legged race
- children of God, through which we have God's life and nature
- luminaries, that we should be light to others
- word of life, which is our supply by making the word life to us
