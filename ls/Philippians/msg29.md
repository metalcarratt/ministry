learn the secret to be content in all things. this secret is to live christ.

paul was initiated into the rudimentary principles of the christian and 
church life, which are how to live christ.

the philippians had opened an 'account' with paul, giving several times, but
at this time they had forgotten a little. but their thinking had blossomed anew.

pt2

paul said first he knew how to be abased and how to abound. that was before epaphroditus came with a gift from the philippians. then he said he knew how to abound and how to lack. he knew that all things are under God's arrangement and that there will continue to be ups and downs, but he had the secret to be in all those things.

the secret paul had was to be in christ. in prior verse he had the aspiration to be found in Him. now that he was in him he could do all things in him.
