pt1

drink offering an extra offering on top of the basic offering of the believers faith.
Paul's martyrdom was an extra offering based on the basic offering.

faith is the sum total of our experience of christ as the offerings. as we experience
christ as the offerings he becomes faith in us. the more we enjoy christ as the offerings
the more we have an accumulation of faith. this faith is a kind of offering that
those who ministered chrsit to us can offer to God. the drink offering is something more
on top of this basic offering.

pt2
