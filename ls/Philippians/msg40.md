wisdom is of our spirit, knowledge of our mind. we need to let the word dwell in us richly
in all wisdom. this means we need to exercise our spirit to take in the word.

the way to let the word dwell in us richly is through singing. through singing we can
also teach and admonish. 

need to learn to take the word by singing.

pt2

singing and psalming the word of god is higher than pray reading the word. when we
sing and psalm we sink into the deepest part of our being and are saturated with
the word of god. then we will sense we are inwardlt filled and saturated and spontaneously live christ.
