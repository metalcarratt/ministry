god did many things such as creation, incarnation, resurrection and ascension. his
two becoming are becoming a man and becoming the spirit.

through his doings he became the spirit and through his speaking he became the word.

if we enjoy the word but do not experience god operating in us, something must be
defective regarding our experience of the spirit. right in our spirit and pure in
our heart, whole being open.

if we have this experience we will hold forth, apply to others, this word we enjoy, which
is to hold forth the word of life.
