anxiety and forbearance are two lives, anxiety the totality of human life and
forbearance the totality of the proper christian life. there are also two sources.
God is the source of forbearance and Satan is the source of anxiety.

our circumstances are permitted by God to deal with us. often God uses Satan to
deal with us. Satan's purpose toward us is always negative, but God's use of
Satan is positive to deal with us. nevertheless, although the circumstances are
allowed by God, the anxiety is not. anxiety has its source in Satan, and is Satan's
attack to frustrate gods purpose.

forbearance and anxiety cannot coexist. if we have one we do not have the other.
we need to live christ as forbearance to be free of anxiety.
