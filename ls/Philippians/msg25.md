basic thought of phil 3 is two groups of ppl distracting the philippians, the
judaisers and the epicurean. the judaisers emphasized the soul while the epicureans
emphasized the enjoyment of the body.

renewing of our mind is a big part of transformation. changing the way we think.
we all have a big tumor in our soul, which is our national characteristics.
