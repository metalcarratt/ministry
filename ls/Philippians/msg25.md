pt1

basic thought of phil 3 is two groups of ppl distracting the philippians, the
judaisers and the epicurean. the judaisers emphasized the soul while the epicureans
emphasized the enjoyment of the body.

renewing of our mind is a big part of transformation. changing the way we think.
we all have a big tumor in our soul, which is our national characteristics.

pt2-pt3

judaisers focused on the soul, epicurean focused on indulgence of the body. to overcome the focus on the soul, we should count all things loss. to overcome the indulgence of the body, we need to be content in all things. we do not practice e asceticism, nor do we indulge. in a sense we are stoic.

we have a citizenship in the heavens. since this is so we ought not indulge in the things of the earth.

our body is a body of humiliation, no matter how we treat it. when the lord comes our body will be condormed to the body of his glory.
