stand firm in spirit, stiving together with one soul.
they are not two matters but one matter. standing requires striving. just like the best defence is offence.

whenever the enemy attacks we need to exerise our spirit by prayer.

defence is standing in spirit. spirit is a realm. offence is with the soul. spuld is an instrument. mind, emotion and will are the insturmentw of the soul for fighting the enemy.
