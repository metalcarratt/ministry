forbearance - 'epi' (extensive) + 'eikos' reasonable, considerate, suitable

forbearance is to understand the situation at hand and react in a way that is full of wisdom
and love. it is not to be excessively strict or excessively loose, but appropriate for the
situation.

examples:
- parents with children. when a child does something wrong we should not react right away. we need to understand the situation and act appropriately
- elders need to deal with saints of many backgrounds and personalities, which requires forbearance
- God was forebearing in all.his dealings with man. he deals with each person differently, according to their person. the bible is a book of forbearance
- Christ was forbearance as well, for example in the way he dealt with his parents when he was 12, or how he dealt with Peter when Peter said he would pay the temple tax
- Paul had forbearance. when he was in prison and had no supply he didn't complain but rejoiced when the philippians remembered him

forbearance requires:
- growth
- the secret of contentment. if we are content in christ we shall be able to forbearance, but if we are unhappy we cannot forbear
