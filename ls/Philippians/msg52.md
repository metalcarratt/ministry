phil 3:8-12 have three words meaning to obtain: gain, obtain, lay hold. gain refers
to our initial salvation, obtain to our transformation, and lay hold to the future.
the way to obtain christ today is to know him by the power of his resurrection, the fellowship
of his sufferings and being conformed to his death. this is a particular kind of
suffering which is for the body. 

many Christians think of God's creative power when they think of power but it is
God's resurrecting power which we need to experience.
