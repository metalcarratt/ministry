the word and the spirit are inseperable. they are like our body and life. one is physical
and visible, the other is spiritual and invisible. but without one the other cannot exist.

the word of christ dwelling in us is equivalent to the lord dwelling in us. to have
the lord dwell in us in a practical way, we need his word to dwell in us.

we can't live christ if we don't eat him as the word. the best way to eat the word is to pray read and sing read the word.
