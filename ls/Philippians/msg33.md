pt1

we shouldnt take the words in the bible for granted. we need ask questions.

the daily salvation paul experienced was that he wouldn't be put to shame in any situation
but rather would magnify christ. for this he needed the bountiful supply of the spirit.

the spirit is on the body, therefore paul had the spirit because he was connected to the
body through the prayer of the saints.

pt2

for our prayer to be effective it must be in the body, for the anointing of the spirit is on the body.

the compound ointment in exodus is a type of the bountiful supply of the spirit. we need to apply this spirit I. our daily lives to receive salvation.

pt3

we need to be in the body to enjoy the bountiful supply of the spirit. if we have a problem with the saints or the elders then it will be hard for us to enjoy the spirit. but if we are right with the body then even a little turning will cause us to be in the enjoyment.

the best vacation is to pray, "Lord jesus, I love you."
