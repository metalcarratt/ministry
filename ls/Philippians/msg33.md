we shouldnt take the words in the bible for granted. we need ask questions.

the daily salvation paul experienced was that he wouldn't be put to shame in any situation
but rather would magnify christ. for this he needed the bountiful supply of the spirit.

the spirit is on the body, therefore paul had the spirit because he was connected to the
body through the prayer of the saints.
