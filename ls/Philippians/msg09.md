paul appealed to the philippians to make his joy full by being one in soul.
he was imprisoned but the dissension among the philippians was of greater
concern to him than his imprisonment.

no rivalry.even our speaking can have rivalry if we are concerned with
how many amens we receive. 

vainglory goes together with rivalry. the opposite is lowliness of mind, an attribute of Christ.

thr believers enjoyment of christ depended on their fellowship with the apostle. the philippian believers fellowship was abnormal because they did not esteem him highly enough to make his joy full by having dissension and rivalry. so they were limited in their experience of christ. the experience of christ is always a body matter, and our relationship with the apostle must be normal for us to have a proper enjoyment of christ.
