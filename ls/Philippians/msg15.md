pt1

the enjoyment of christ always issues in caring
for the saints and the churches. they should not be separated.

need to be like souled, like minded. if we exercise our soul we cannot be
one in soul, but if we exercise our spirit we will be one in the soul.

pt2

we can enjoy christ in our spirit but may not be one in our soul with others. elders may enjoy christ in spirit but have different concern for the churches. to care for the church properly the elders need to be like souled.

epaphroditus also risked his soul life. we should be those who are willing to task our soul life for the sake of the churches.
