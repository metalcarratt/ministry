church in philipi had good order with saints, elders and deacons. but had some
dissension. they were one in spirit but not in the mind. also, they needed love
in knowledge and discernment because there were ones preaching the gospel in a
way that didnt match gods economy. love in knowledge is Important humanly because
the mind and emotions do not go together. to have such a discerning love we need
to experience christ.
