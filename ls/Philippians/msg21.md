pt1

illustration: knowing about food, buying ingredients and putting them in our house, preparing and cooking the food to eat it.

this is like the excellency of the knowledge, which must come first and motivates us.
then we must gain christ by paying the price to be found in Him. finally we can enjoy christ.

our greatest lack is living christ all the time. Instead we are in many other things such as philosophy, logic and culture.
