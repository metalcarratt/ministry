pt1

Phil. 4:5-9 presents 8 items which are an expression of christ. Earlier paul said we
need to be conformed to the pattern of christ. we also need to count all things loss
on account of christ. the practical illustration of such a life is these points.

the first point is forbearance. if we react to others when they provoke us that is
not forbearance. sometimes we just need to be quite. even our exercise of the spirit
needs to be quiet and inward to not further provoke the other person.
