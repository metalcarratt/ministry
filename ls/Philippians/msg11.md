we need to live crucified and resurrected life to escape rivalry and vain glory.

we need to exalt christ and experience his exaltation by living a crucified life.

experiencing his exaltation is part of the salvation we need to work out and is synonymous with the power of Christ's resurrection.

christ has the highest name above all names. we should call on his name to exalt and worship him, and even bow our knees when we call to worship him.
