paul magnified christ in his prison. to magnify christ is to make christ
large in the sight of others. paul may not have had the opportunity to speak christ,
nevertheless he magnified christ, particularly through the exercise of christ
as his patience.

paul also said to him to live is christ. it starts with "for" indicating that
living christ was the way he was able to magnify christ.

we need to live christ. any thing else is a distraction. it is possible for us to have a change in our behavior but that may not be living christ, just imitation in our natural man. the hardest thing for us to learn is how to live christ daily.
