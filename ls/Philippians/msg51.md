righteousness of god through faith. righteousness if God himself. it is god lived out
of us as righteousness. for this we need faith.

Phil 1-3 cover three matters, the bountiful supply of the spirit of Jesus christ, 
the word of life, and the faith of christ. through these three things we can be practically
found in christ, and the expression of this will be the righteousness of god.
