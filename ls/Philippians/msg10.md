p1

pauls concern was not that the philippians respected him and had a positive
attitude toward him, but that they were experiencing christ.

christ is our pattern, but not just in an objective way. he is subjectively within
us as a pattern. this is to work out our own salvation.

p2+3

christ lived a crucified life. he laid aside the outward form of God, took on the form of a slave, became in the likeness of man, was obedient, unto death, the death of a cross. this was a humiliation.

only the crucified life could enable us to live without rivalry and vainglory. only this could make the apostles joy full. paul, who was in prison, was not concerned with how others treated him but with whether or not the believers were living a crucified life.
