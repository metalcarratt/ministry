pt1

ch3 turns to talk about judaizers. paul sounded like he was finished at end of ch2
but in ch3 he continued. probably the matter of judaizers was a big burden on his heart.

judaisers were called by paul: dogs, evil workers and concision. concision means mutilation,
a word of contempt for circumcision. paul was as strong as John the Baptist and Jesus
in pointing out the evil of the judaizers.

the believers are, on the contrary, those who serve by the spirit, boast in christ,
have no confidence in the flesh.

paul gave himself as an example of a judaizer.
