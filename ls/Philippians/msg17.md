pt1

ch3 turns to talk about judaizers. paul sounded like he was finished at end of ch2
but in ch3 he continued. probably the matter of judaizers was a big burden on his heart.

judaisers were called by paul: dogs, evil workers and concision. concision means mutilation,
a word of contempt for circumcision. paul was as strong as John the Baptist and Jesus
in pointing out the evil of the judaizers.

the believers are, on the contrary, those who serve by the spirit, boast in christ,
have no confidence in the flesh.

paul gave himself as an example of a judaizer.

pt2

pauls example was to show the philippians that although he had been a top one
of these kinds of people he had had a big turn from those things.

in principle we can be the same as the judaisers if we have any confidence in our
natural qualifications, ability or intelligence.
