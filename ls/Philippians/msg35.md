pt1

two sections on salvation, 1:19-21 and 2:12-13,16. these verses are not about god's salvation
of us from hell, but of our own salvation in our daily circumstances. we need to enjoy
the bountiful supply of the spirit, being energized by the Spirit so that when we are
in pressing situations we can work out our salvation. otherwise instead of salvation
there will be shame. when we do this christ is also magnified.

pt2

the bountiful supply of the spirit is in the word. in the difficult situation when we turn to the lord we may get the word. that word supplies us and saves us.

we may come to the spirit and get the instant word. or we may come to the word and get the spirit. either way the word and the spirit are connected.

thr spirit is God himself reaching us.

the way to receive the word is by all prayer. this is pray reading. we need to pray and exercise our spirit when we come to the word. then the word becomes the bountiful supply of the spirit, which is God reaching us and becoming our salvation.
