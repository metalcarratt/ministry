two sections on salvation, 1:19-21 and 2:12-13,16. these verses are not about god's salvation
of us from hell, but of our own salvation in our daily circumstances. we need to enjoy
the bountiful supply of the spirit, being energized by the Spirit so that when we are
in pressing situations we can work out our salvation. otherwise instead of salvation
there will be shame. when we do this christ is also magnified.
