pt1

six further aspects of living christ:

- truthful
- honorable
- righteous
- pure
- lovely
- well spoken of

paul charges us to live christ, sets forth christ as the pattern, and counted all things 
dung compared to christ. this proves this aspects cannot be something apart from christ.

virtue and praise are a summary of the aspects of a life of living christ.

pt2-3

these virtues are not something natural. we are like glove needing a hand. otherwise our virtues are empty.
