we need to live by Christ, not by ethics or philosophy or diplomacy. many saints who think
they are spiritual may actually just be in ethics and philosophy.

there is a large gap between our vision of some aspects of christ, such as the reality
of all positive things, and our experience of this in our daily lives. we need to
see christ in such a way that this seeing changes our daily living.
