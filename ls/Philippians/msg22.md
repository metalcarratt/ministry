pt1

we need to live by Christ, not by ethics or philosophy or diplomacy. many saints who think
they are spiritual may actually just be in ethics and philosophy.

there is a large gap between our vision of some aspects of christ, such as the reality
of all positive things, and our experience of this in our daily lives. we need to
see christ in such a way that this seeing changes our daily living.

pt2

Christian life is like a carnation seed. the seed needs to fall into the ground and die for the life within to be released.

need to be conformed to Christ's death. not just bad part but also good part of
our humanity, such as our ethics or diplomacy, need to be put to death that Christ's life can flow. even the lord jesus lived a life under death, being baptized at the start of his ministry.

pt3

problem - not willing to put to death the good part of our natural man, especially
our national characteristics. hinders us from growth in life. many saints stuck here for years.

out resurrection. can only be reached by conformity to death of christ.
