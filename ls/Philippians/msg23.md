pt1

our salvation was god gaining us that we might gain him.

paul did not consider himself to have gained christ to the fullest extent. christ was like a vast land that he wanted to continuously explore.

gaining christ is the way for us to grow in life.

pt2

the goal of gods calling and our prize is the top enjoyment of christ. there is an our resurrection from the dead and an extra portion of the enjoyment of christ. just as some of those who graduate from a class graduate with a special prize, so some believers who are resurrected will have an extra portion of the enjoyment of christ. this was the goal toward which paul sought.

paul pursued christ to the point of positively persecuting him. that is, he would not let him go.
