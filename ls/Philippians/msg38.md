pt1

christ is extensive, like colossians says, the body of all positive things. he is our holiday. if we are in him every day will be a holiday.

he is our life supply. we can never graduate from the thing of life.

we are his sons. as his sons we need to live christ and be found in him. 

pt2

the spirit is the whole God reaching us, not just one third.

the spirit witneses with our spirit that we are children of God, thus we can have
assurance that we are children of God.

we need both the word and the spirit. the word is the embodiment of the word. we have the spirit within and the word without and we need to enjoy both.

pt3

four basic verses:
- col. 2:9, "fulness of the godhead"
- eph. 3:8, "unreachable riches of christ"
- Phil. 1:19, "bountiful supply of the spirit of Jesus christ"
- col. 3:16, "word of christ dwell in you richly"

a difference between memorizing verses and having the word dwell in us richly.

we need to pray when we come to the word to get the bountiful supply of the spirit, the riches of christ and the fulness of the godhead.

the fulness comes from both the spirit and the word. the same if true with knowing the will of God.
