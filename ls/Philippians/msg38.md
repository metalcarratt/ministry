pt1

christ is extensive, like colossians says, the body of all positive things. he is our holiday. if we are in him every day will be a holiday.

he is our life supply. we can never graduate from the thing of life.

we are his sons. as his sons we need to live christ and be found in him. 

pt2

the spirit is the whole God reaching us, not just one third.

the spirit witneses with our spirit that we are children of God, thus we can have
assurance that we are children of God.

we need both the word and the spirit. the word is the embodiment of the word. we have the spirit within and the word without and we need to enjoy both.
