pt1

the excellency of the knowledge is based on the person of christ.
christ is excellent but before we know about him we are not willing to count
all things dung. once we have this excellent knowledge we count all things dung for him.

pt2

the excellency of the knowledge actually means to have a vision, a revelation
of Christ. when you visit Hong Kong the merchants know how to sell jade by explaining to the customers about it. after hearing many things about the jade the customers are willing to pay the price to gain it.

the extensiveness of christ is seen in colossians 2:16, 17 which talks about christ being the body of the shadows, the new moon, sabbath, eating, drinking, etc.
