# what is the gospel
Mark starts with the gospel - as a slave the most important thing to the Lord was His service

Gospel is more than just glad tidings

## Dispensations (7)

- conscience (before flood)
- government (after flood)
- promise (from Abraham)
- law (from Moses)
- grace (from Christ)
- kingdom

## what OT is
Full definition of the gospel
