## The ministry of John

The dispensation of grace began with the
coming of John the Baptism. He brought
with him a ministry and repentance. He was 
unreligious and uncultured, a new start.

John came to make ready the way and straight
the paths of the Lord. The way is to have a
turn of heart, where-as the paths are all the
avenues of our heart that need straightening
to be able to receive the Lord.

The baptism of John (by water) terminated people. The
baptism of the Lord (by the Spirit) 
germinates people.

## The Lord baptised and tested

The Lord was baptised by John. Repentance
means to have a turn. It is not only to
bury all the negative things, but to also
turn from the natural way of life to God.
This is why Jesus, who had no sin, could
be baptised. He was testifying that He 
would live only for God.

After baptism the Lord was tested. He was tested
to see if He would be obedient to the
Spirit, and He was.
