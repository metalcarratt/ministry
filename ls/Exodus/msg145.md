many ways to interpret (or not) the types in the
old testament. we need to see that the pictures
in the old testament unveil something we cannot
see with only the plain words in the new testament.
for example, no matter how many words we use to
describe someones face, we cannot have a proper
realisation until we actually see a picture of it.
