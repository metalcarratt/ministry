an omer full of manna was kept in a golden pot in the ark in the holy of holies,
in the tabernacle, within the outer court, beneath five layers of coverings. it was
at the center. this shows that the christ we have enjoyed, digested and assimilated
should be the center of our being.

this manna was kept as a memorial. in eternity it is the christ we have experienced and enjoyed today that we will remember.
