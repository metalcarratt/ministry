the word 'ephod' is direct from hebrew
because there is no english equivalent.
before moses received the revelation concerning
the priestly garments, this concept did not
exist in human society.

according to the dictionary ephod means
to bind, fasten, gird, link. the purpose
of the ephod was to connect the breastplate
and shoulder plates, and to fasten them
to the high priests clothing.

only the high priest could wear the ephod,
so only Christ has the binding power. he holds
us and bears us on his shoulders and breasts,
but it is not like being carried, it is like
being fastened onto christ.
