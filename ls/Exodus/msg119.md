the word 'ephod' is direct from hebrew
because there is no english equivalent.
before moses received the revelation concerning
the priestly garments, this concept did not
exist in human society.

according to the dictionary ephod means
to bind, fasten, gird, link. the purpose
of the ephod was to connect the breastplate
and shoulder plates, and to fasten them
to the high priests clothing.

only the high priest could wear the ephod,
so only Christ has the binding power. he holds
us and bears us on his shoulders and breasts,
but it is not like being carried, it is like
being fastened onto christ.

sometimes we know we should have faith but it seems the more we pray for faith the less we have. we dont doubt the basic faith in the lord but we do doubt his working to hold us in our environment. how do we deal with this? we need to see that the lords glory and humanity are the holding power. when we read the gospels and appreciate the beauty and glory displayed in them, spontaneously we are connected to him and filled with faith. br lee had this experience when he had tubeeculosis and he had no faith that the lord would heal him.
