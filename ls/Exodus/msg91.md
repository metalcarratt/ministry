the height of the table of the presence was the sam3 height as the ark, showing that
our enjoyment needs to be up to the standard of the ark of the testimony. if our
enjoyment of Christ does not come up to the standard of God's testimony it is defective
and below the standard.

> our enjoyment of christ through the word must be very high. no place should be given to any gimmicks which lower the standard.

a frame roundabout is for strengthening. when we eat christ we shouod be strengthened.

the bread of the presence is the bread eaten in gods presence, the face bread. this bread is eaten in gods presence and in the tent of meeting, in the meetings of the church. unlike the manna, it cannot be enjoyed apart from gods presence, and it needs the corporate enjoyment.

the ark and the table were very similar. same height, same materials, same rings and poles. this shows that experientially the table comes out of the ark, but also that the table brings us back to the ark.
