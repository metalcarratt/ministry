the height of the table of the presence was the sam3 height as the ark, showing that
our enjoyment needs to be up to the standard of the ark of the testimony. if our
enjoyment of Christ does not come up to the standard of God's testimony it is defective
and below the standard.

> our enjoyment of christ through the word must be very high. no place should be given to any gimmicks which lower the standard.
