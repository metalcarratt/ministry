we should not talk to the lord in a formal way
but in a loving intimate way, like how we would
speak with the members of our family. if we look
at how the disciples conversed with the lord we
will also see that they did not speak with him
in a formal way.

our meetings are still heavily affected by our religious concept. if we experience christ as the bull, lambs, flour, oil and wine when we come to the meetings we will be rescued from formality.
