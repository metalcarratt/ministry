as the lamb of God, Jesus was:
- obedient unto death
- meek as a lamb to the slaughter

if we daily take christ as the sin offering spontaneously we will start to experience christ as the lamb. we will become obedient and meek, not fighting with our spouse 

> i know from experience that when we raise Christ as a bull for a sin offering, we also raise Him as a ram for a burnt offering. Offering Christ as the sin offering is the way to raise Christ as a lamb.
