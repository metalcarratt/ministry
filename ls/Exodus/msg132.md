holiness is not just being upright
or sinlessly perfect. nor is it merely
to be separated positionally. holiness
is to have God's nature put into us.

there are degrees of holiness, which is
the degree to which we are separated wholy
unto the Lord. the top part was for only
God to enjoy, and the high priest was charged
with guarding that portion so that no
one else could take it. this is Christ,
keeping and guarding our topmost holiness
to the Lord.
