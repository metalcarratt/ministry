with the drinking comes the flowing. if we do not have the flowing eventually our
drinking will be nullified. in one sense the flowing is more important than the drinking.
most Christians either do not drink or do not flow. either way the drinking ceases.

lack of flowing will also cause our thirst to stop. the proper gospel preaching stirs up a thrist within people. a good salesman knows how to make something attractive to people. this is to stir up a thirst.

if the flowing stops the drinking stops. if the drinking stopsthe thirst will stop. then we will have to go through a period of spiritual death before our thirst can be recovered.

> what is particularly helpful to bring about the inner flowing is speaking to the lord, by the lord, for the lord, in the lord, and with the Lord. the more we speak in this way, the more we shall flow. if there is no one to whom we may speak, we should speak to the things in our room. speak to the desk, the door, the walls. speak to anything and everything. if you have a pet in your house, speak to it. speak to the dog, the cat, the birds, or the fish. some may regard this practice as ridiculous, but I can testify of the difference it makes to speak. Christians should not be dumb, silent. on the contrary, we must be those bubbling, and welling up with life. we all have something to which we can speak. we can speak to the windows, to the doors, and to bricks and stones. when we speak, something of the Lord Jesus flows out. by speaking we are like a water hose which has both the inflow and the outflow.
