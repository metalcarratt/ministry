with the drinking comes the flowing. if we do not have the flowing eventually our
drinking will be nullified. in one sense the flowing is more important than the drinking.
most Christians either do not drink or do not flow. either way the drinking ceases.

lack of flowing will also cause our thirst to stop. the proper gospel preaching stirs up a thrist within people. a good salesman knows how to make something attractive to people. this is to stir up a thirst.
