moses was matched by aaron. it almost seemed as if god was waiting for moses to display
his lack of confidence so that he could match him with Aaron. we should never do
anything individualistically. God's principle is always that we would be matched with
others. this is for the building up of the body. however such matching is not always
easy.

zipporah... can't quite get this point. zipporah may have resisted fully following her Husband. so her first son was circumcised but not her second. it wasn't until God tried to kill moses, who was weak in dealing with issue, that she crudely circumcised her second son. often our wives may not have a problem with us when we are not following the lord, but when we decide to follow him some resistance occurs. then forcefully they are drawn to obey? not sure about this..
