there are two aspects to the law, the "day" aspect and the "night" aspect. whether
we experience it as the day or as the night depends on our condition. we need to
realise the crucial importance of our condition when we come to the word. 

when the words of the Lord were presented to the children of israel their response
was that they would do it. they did not know themselves and recognise their position.
this changed their day to night. they did not know they needed gods mercy.

the people were at three distances: moses was on the mountaintop being infused, Aaron
and the elders were afar and watching, and the people were at the bottom trembling.

when the devil tempted eve he infused her with the devilish thought into her mind.
by speaking to him and answering her question his devilish thought got into her mind.
first the devilish thought got into man's mind and then man acted according to the
devilish thought. as a result the nature of the devil got into man's flesh. the consequences
is that the devilish thought and nature separated man from God. this man fallen man
a creature after the devils kind.
