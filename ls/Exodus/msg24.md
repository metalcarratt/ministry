the account of thr passover lamb is full of details showing that we need to pay
particular attention to the redemption of christ and never forget it. for example
the bones were not broken, signifying christs indestructible life. in Genesis it was
Adam's bone that gave life to eve.

important to see _how_ to eat the passover. the children of israel ate it in haste.
this is because they were gods army, ready to leave at any time. we should not think
after being saved we will be carried away to heaven in a palanquin. rather we are
formed to be gods army.
