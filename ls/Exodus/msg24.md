the account of thr passover lamb is full of details showing that we need to pay
particular attention to the redemption of christ and never forget it. for example
the bones were not broken, signifying christs indestructible life. in Genesis it was
Adam's bone that gave life to eve.

important to see _how_ to eat the passover. the children of israel ate it in haste.
this is because they were gods army, ready to leave at any time. we should not think
after being saved we will be carried away to heaven in a palanquin. rather we are
formed to be gods army.

loins girded, shoes on feet, staff in hand, eaten in haste.

remain in the house. the way to experience redemption is to be in the house (to be one with christ). we get into the house through the blood. but we need to remain in the house. the reason we don't agree with many teachings in Christianity is that they encourage us to leave the house. but everything is in the house. we should stay in the abiding by remaining in the house.
