the breaking of the law is related to idolatry. the reason we break the law and are
not able to keep it is because we have idols. the writings of John charge us to keep
the commandments. the reason John could charge us in this way is because we bave Christ
as our enjoyment. there is no need for us to try and keep the commandments. actually,
our enjoying of Christ is our keeping of the commandments.
