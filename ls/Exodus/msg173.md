the breaking of the law is related to idolatry. the reason we break the law and are
not able to keep it is because we have idols. the writings of John charge us to keep
the commandments. the reason John could charge us in this way is because we bave Christ
as our enjoyment. there is no need for us to try and keep the commandments. actually,
our enjoying of Christ is our keeping of the commandments.

the second principle of the breaking of the law is self beautification. the idol
was made of the earrings of the wives, sons and daughters. before the gold earrings became an idol it was already an idol in the form of self beautification. today people may not have many physical idols of wood or stone but they spend a great deal of tine and money of self beautification.

the gold used to make the idols was gold that should have been used to build the tabernacle. this shows that Satan comes to usurp the God given talent we have, that should be used for God's building, and to make it a waste.

another principle is that the worshio of the golden calf was a worship of enjoyment. they ate, drank, played, sang and danced in front of the calf. a calf itself is for feasting on, for enjoyment.
