moses became a mediator between God and His people. he could do this because
He was a "companion" of God. the time Moses spent with God in the mountain must
have been spent in intimate fellowship with God. it was not merely passing down the
details of the tabernacle. abraham was called the friend of God and also interceeded
for Lot. but "companion" is a deeper expression than "friend". it implies an intimate
association. this means that they had a common goal and purpose. because of this,
Moses could not only interceed for the children of Israel, but God trusted him to
deal with thr situation with instruction. He merely told Moses what they had done
and left the rest to them. Moses' grinding the gold and mixing with the water and
so on were not God's instruction, but they were according to God"s heart because
what he did was as a companion of God.
