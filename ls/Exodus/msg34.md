eating the quails was for the satisfaction of the flesh, eating the manna is for the
heavenly life supply. when the quails were sent they were sent without restraint. but
with the manna there was much restraint. for example, they had to gather it in the morning,
and not gather too much. they could not gather in a greedy way. on the sabbath they could
not gather at all, but had to gather twice as much on the sixth day. all these show that
to eat manna is to be according to god.

> eating quails makes people wild and unrestricted, but eating manna regulates them and causes them to be according to God.

the lord needs to change not only our diet but also our appetite. the Lord is the real manna (John 6). in the wilderness for forty years the children of israel did nothing but eat the manna and care for the tabernacle. we also need to focus our attention and our appetite on eating the Lord and caring for the church.
