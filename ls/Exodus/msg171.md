all the saints being skilled in workmanship:
- working in gold, silver and bronze
- cutting (transformed) stones for setting - cutting is to build and place together
- carving wood - work on humanity
- spinning, weaving, emroidery, work on animal skins - producing finer human virtues with the uplifted humanity of Christ.

by: learning to fellowship in the meetings and in spiritual contact with the saints.

oholiab was the co-master builder. he was from the tribe of dan, the lowest tribe.
he was one who taught others how to build.

the builders themselves had wisdom and were stirred up in heart, a heart burning for gods building.
