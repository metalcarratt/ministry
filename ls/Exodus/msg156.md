laver

the incense altar is gold, the propitiation silver
is silver and the laver is bronze. these are all
metals used for the building of the tabernacle.

the incense altar is for God's move, and God moves
via the army, which is formed using the propitiation
silver. however for the operation of the tabernacle,
for the priests to dress the lamps and so on,
they had to be washed. for this there is the need
of the laver.

any serivce in the tabernacle required washing with the laver. this is different from the cleansing of the blood from sins. this washing is from contamination with the earthly things and is in water. we may pray much, but how much are we washed before we pray?
