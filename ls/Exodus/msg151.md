those who offered sacrifices at the bronze altar
in the outer court surely would have prayed,
but such prayer is _to_ God, not _in_ God, and
it is related to the crucified Christ as either
our sin offering or tresspass offering. however
the prayers offered at the incense altar were prayers
offered _in_ God (since the word is God and the word
tabernacled among us). it is also related to the
resurrected and ascended Christ.

the two altars were connected by the blood and the fire. the blood of the sin offering was sprinkled on the incense altar, showing that our prayer at the incense altar is based on the forgiveness of sins and our substitute. the fire that burned on the incense altar was also taken from the first altar.
