those who offered sacrifices at the bronze altar
in the outer court surely would have prayed,
but such prayer is _to_ God, not _in_ God, and
it is related to the crucified Christ as either
our sin offering or tresspass offering. however
the prayers offered at the incense altar were prayers
offered _in_ God (since the word is God and the word
tabernacled among us). it is also related to the
resurrected and ascended Christ.
