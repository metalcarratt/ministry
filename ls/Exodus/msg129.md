we need to be transformed, inscribed
with definite experiences of Christ,
and have the light, so that God can use
us as a breastplate in our church.

God speaks through the darkening of the stones, which is why most of Paul's epistles were written, for example 1 Cor. But to read the stonea through darkening there first needs to be the transformation, the transparency, the inscribing and the shining of the light. otherwise if there is no light how can we know when one goes dark? if there is no inscribing, how can we know what the darkness means?
