in the proper worship to God, He gave some rules as supplements to the law.
there are some interesting details:
- no idols of gold or silver. the fact gold and silver are mentioned specifically, rather than wood or stone, indicate that mammon is a particular kind of idol that the lord despises
- building an altar. an altar is a type of the cross. we cannot worship God without the cross.
- made of earth or unhewn stone. we cannot add to the cross, but only take what God has provided. if we try to cut the stone for beautification we polluted it. choosing between earth or stone also means the cross is accessible, since those who cannot use stone can use earth.
- we cannot go up to the altar by steps. access to the cross is free for all, and there is no hierarchy in the worship of God.
- with the burnt offerings and peace offerings, both of which are for fellowship, not redemption.
- remembering the lords name. we must drop every other name.
