the altar was heavy (approx 2400kg) and would have required at least four people, perhaps even sixteen, to
carry it. this points to the need for a corporate body, the church, for the move
of the cross. this must also be a church with the four rings connected to the
grating, i.e. a church connected to and remaining in the spirit.

in the picture of the grating, the rings and the poles we have Christ, the Spirit and the Church. this is a summary of the NT. Christ accomplished redemption through the eternal Spirit, and this Christ with the cross is borne by the Church as a corporate body.
