four additional matters related to the exodus of gods people from egypt:
- sanctified - we need christ as our substitute for redemption, but we also need christ as our substitute for sanctification
- month of abib - meaning sprouting, budding. every day should be a day of new life and enjoying christ as the sinless one (unleavened bread). the more days we have of enjoying new life and dealing with sin, the more we will have as a memorial to remember in the new jerusalem.
- Joseph's bones brought into the good land - bone signifies the unbreakable resurrection life. in God's eyes, Egypt was a cemetery where all his people were bones buried. the exodus was a bringing of his people into resurrection. the exodus is made in resurrection life. no one can come out of the world without being enlivened by the resurrection life. only when our dry bones are made alive by the resurrection life can we come out of the world.
- gods leading
  - in resurrection life. gods guidance only comes to bones in resurrection. many Christians are seeking gods will, leading and guidance, but do not have it because they are not bones moving in the power of resurrection.
  - the children of israel had not only the Lord's command but also his leading and guidance by the pillar of cloud and fire. if he asks us to do something we must have his leading and guidance also, not only his command.
  - prerequisites: sanctification > new, sinless life > resurrection > leading and guidance.
  - God lead the children of israel the long way so that they would not return to Egypt when they saw war. often gods leading is in a round about way to prevent us from going back to the world.
  - clouds signifies the spirit, fire signifies the word. the Lord, the spirit and the word are all one for our leading. when we are clear (in the day) the spirit leads. when we are not clear (in the night) the word leads and makes our night day and then becomes the spirit.
