four additional matters related to the exodus of gods people from egypt:
- sanctified - we need christ as our substitute for redemption, but we also need christ as our substitute for sanctification
- month of abib - meaning sprouting, budding. every day should be a day of new life and enjoying christ as the sinless one (unleavened bread). the more days we have of enjoying new life and dealing with sin, the more we will have as a memorial to remember in the new jerusalem.
