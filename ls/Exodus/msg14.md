experientially, god was known to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob as El shaddai but not as jehovah.
El shaddai, the all sufficient god, is gods name for supply and promise. as El shaddai
god made a promise to them and supplied them their needs. jehovah is the name for existence
and fulfillment. when god appeared to Moses he came to fulfill his promise made to Abraham,
Isaac and jacob.

because God is self existing and ever existing he is able to fulfill his promise. Abraham has still not personally received the promise of the good land, but because God is the god of resurrection, and because he is the self existing and ever existing one, he is able to fulfill it.

the name Jesus means jehovah the savior. he came to save as the self existing and ever existing one. he came not to promise but to fulfill.
