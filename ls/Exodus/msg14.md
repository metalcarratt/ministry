experientially, god was known to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob as El shaddai but not as jehovah.
El shaddai, the all sufficient god, is gods name for supply and promise. as El shaddai
god made a promise to them and supplied them their needs. jehovah is the name for existence
and fulfillment. when god appeared to Moses he came to fulfill his promise made to Abraham,
Isaac and jacob.
