Christ is typified by the ark and covering. the ark typifies christ as the testimony of
god and the covering signifies christ in his redemptive work. it would be blasphemous
for us to presume we can have a share in christs redemptive work, but as the standing
boards we *can* share in his being a testimony. the boards were acacia wood covered with
gold, the same materials as the ark. this shows that we, as the boards, are the corporate
enlargement of the ark as the testimony of god.

to speak what we are in faith (boards of acacia wood overlaid with gold) is to fan our spirit into flame. when peter believed the lords word he could walk on the water but when he looked at the environment he began to sink. we are the same and should speak by faith.

> when tbe lord told peter to step out of the boat and come to him on the water, peter did so. he walked on the water according to the word of christ. but when he looked at the environment his faith disappeared.
