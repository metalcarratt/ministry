Christ is typified by the ark and covering. the ark typifies christ as the testimony of
god and the covering signifies christ in his redemptive work. it would be blasphemous
for us to presume we can have a share in christs redemptive work, but as the standing
boards we *can* share in his being a testimony. the boards were acacia wood covered with
gold, the same materials as the ark. this shows that we, as the boards, are the corporate
enlargement of the ark as the testimony of god.
