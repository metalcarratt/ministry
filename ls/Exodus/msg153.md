expiation silver - census taken

a number of questions:
- why immediately after the matter of the incense altar?
- why further redemption needed beyond the passover lamb?
- why only men aged 20 and up?
- why a heave offering?
- why silver and not blood of lamb?

men aged 20 and up are for forming of an army.

the relationship between the incense altar and the census is the forming of an army. when we come to intercede at the incense altar to carry out God's purpose there is the need for warfare to fulfill it. for this a census was needed.
