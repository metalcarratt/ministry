details about manna #2:
- small enough to eat. Christianity is full of desire for bigness and greatness, but christ came as food to eat. (side: I appreciated how the bible itself has been divided into verses, which makes it possible to take in in small, bit sized ways)
- fine, balanced
- round, eternal
- white, pure. eating christ purifies us
- frost, with killing power and cooling power. the killing power kills the negative things in us. the cooling power cools down our feverish sinful things and pentecostal things.
- solid, needed to be ground, beaten and boiled before it could be eaten. need to experience the lord in many situations in order to grind, beat and boil him. then he can be food to us.
- like bdellium, a pearl. 'appearance of' actually means 'eye'. manna had an eye, which was like a pearl. the more we eat christ the more we become like a transparent eye, full of light and sight
- tasting like oil, the spirit, fragrant
- tasting like honey, sweet
- good for making cakes, nutrious
- a mystery, what is it?
