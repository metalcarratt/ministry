details about manna #2:
- small enough to eat. Christianity is full of desire for bigness and greatness, but christ came as food to eat. (side: I appreciated how the bible itself has been divided into verses, which makes it possible to take in in small, bit sized ways)
- fine, balanced
- round, eternal
- white, pure. eating christ purifies us
- frost, with killing power and cooling power. the killing power kills the negative things in us. the cooling power cools down our feverish sinful things and pentecostal things.
