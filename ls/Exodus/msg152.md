the bronze altar, table, lampstand, ark and incense
altar all have a kind of depth. when we say we 
are in God we could be at any one of these places.
but our destination should be the incense altar.
we need to have expeiences at all the items buwe shouldnt
stay here. our desitnation should be the incense altar
and we should linger here.

the kind of prayer we pray indicates where we are
and what kind of person we are.
