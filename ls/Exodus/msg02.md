genesis ends with the death of joseph and exodus is a continuation of genesis, showing
that gods people were in death. although they were in death they also being killed
each day. the world brings in slavery and death. people think the world is advancing but
actually there is more spiritual slavery and death today than ever before. while genesis ends with death exodus ends with the ark of the tabernacle filled with glory.

the slavery in Egypt came about from the need to earn a living. the pursuit of entertainment and higher education is also to secure a better living.

the world usurpation gods people from fulfilling his purpose. exodus 1:7 says they grew strong exceedingly, probably indicating them becoming rich.

v10 Pharoah said, "Let us deal wisely with them." we do not realise how wise Satan is in usurping us to frustrate gods purpose.
