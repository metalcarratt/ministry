> To receive the anointing is to receive the divine painting.  ... In our experience of the Spirit we need to be "painted" again and again. Eventually we may receive hundreds of layers.

> **As** the anointing is being applied to us, it teaches us. Today God mainly teaches us silently by the anointing. For example, you may ask the Lord about something, and He will teach you concerning it by anointing you. If you would say, "Lord, please tell me what color you want," the Lord may not say anything. Instead, He may pick up His "brush" and paint you a particular color, perhaps green. Instead of speaking to you about the color green, He tells you that He wants green by painting you green. This is the Lird's way to teach us.
