#### one with the sacrifice
when the children of israel sacrificed to jehovah they had to place their hand
on the head of the offering before they killed it. laying their hand on the animal's
head identified them with that animal, so that when they killed it they were killed
with it. similarily we can worship God only because we have been identified with christ.
in fact, the ones who killed him were us, for we were the ones who needed his death
in order to be redeemed.

#### the devil working
the devil is a murderer and the father of lies. if we have murdering and lies in us it is proof that the devil is working in us.


#### killing a man by mistake
Ex 21:13
> But if he did not lie in wait for him, but God allowed him to fall by his hand, then I will appoint you a place where he may flee to.

the one killed by mistake was Chirst, put to death by us the sinners. The Lord also prayed, "father, forgive them for they do not know what they are doing." God delivered Him to use by His sovereignty. now we may flee to Christ as our refuge. 

#### stealing
> stealing signifying that fallen man is not satisfied with God's sovereign assignment and tries to make base gain by transgressing God's regulation. Perhaps, in His arrangement, God does not assign many riches to you. Instead, He arranges for you to be in poverty. Are you willing to be satisfied with the circumstances in which God has placed you? If you are not satisifed, you may resort to stealing... in itself stealing is not always serious. What is serious with respect to stealing is transgressing God's regulation.
