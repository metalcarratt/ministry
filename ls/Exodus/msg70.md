when the children of israel sacrificed to jehovah they had to place their hand
on the head of the offering before they killed it. laying their hand on the animal's
head identified them with that animal, so that when they killed it they were killed
with it. similarily we can worship God only because we have been identified with christ.
in fact, the ones who killed him were us, for we were the ones who needed his death
in order to be redeemed.

the devil is a murderer and the father of lies. if we have murdering and lies in us it is proof that the devil is working in us.
