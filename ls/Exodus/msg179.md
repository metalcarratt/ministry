God called Moses to come up the mountain to rewrite the ten commandments, but
instead of doing so straight away He commanded Moses regarding three feasts, the 
feast of unleavened bread, the feast of pentecost and the feast of tabernacles. He
also commanded regarding the sabbath. this means that our primary need is to feast
on the Lord and rest in Him. if we do not feast on the Lord and rest in Him we will
not be able to keep the commandments but if we feast and reast we will spontaneously
fulfill the commandments. every day we need to enjoy these feasts and every hour we
need to enjoy Christ as our Sabbath rest.

our enjoyment of the Lord will keep away the enemy.
