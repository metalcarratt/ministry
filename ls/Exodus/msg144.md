grains of wheat aignify Christ as the life giver.
in john 6 he is the bread that came down out
of heaven and in john 12 he is the grain that fell
into the earth and died. both are for feeding
and producing life.

as with the lamb, the prinary way to enjoy Christ
as the wheat is to take the sin offering every
morning. we need to mean business with the lord
to live him, and we do this by taking Him as our
sin offering in a definite way.

oil is a type of the pneumatic Christ, Christ as the Spirit. we grow Christ as an olive tree by always exercising our spirit, and by doing everything in our spirit.

wine is to be willing to pour out and sacrifice what we have experienced, to die for the lord. the amount of wine was equal to the amount of oil showing we cannot pour out more than we have experienced of the lord as the spirit in pur daily life.
