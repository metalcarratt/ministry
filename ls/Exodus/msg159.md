the reaon moat christians cannot interpret the anointing oil is that they have not experienced it. the reason they have not experienced it is because the anointing is for the house. it is only after the building of the tabernacle and the preparation of the body of priests is ready that the anointing oil is revealed 

the preparation of the ingredients all involved symbols of suffering. the olives had to be pressed to make oil; the myrhh tree had to be cut for the resin to flow out. the cinammon and cassia come from the inner and outer part of the bark of the tree, which involves the stripping of the bark. this shows that the compounding of the ointment came from the sufferings the Lord suffered in His human life.

when myrrh resin flows out of a tree it has the appearance of tears. the blood and tears issuing from our body are signs of suffering.
