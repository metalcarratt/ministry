the lampstand is a tree growing with life and the light is the blossoming out of
this life. in the lampstand we see the divine nature, resurrection, the spirit, life
and light. since we have all these things we are parts of the lampstand.

the wicks of the lamp are the only part that is not divine and represent our humanity. every morning the priests had to trim the wicks of the charred black parts. morning revival is an excellent time for us to trim the wicks by reviewing our previous day and confessing our sins.

the fruit of the lampstand is light. if we are growing in life then unconsciously we will shine with light to others. we may even trim their wicks. the light will touch the improper things in them and cause them to adjust by life.

the snuffers and snuff dishes are made of pure gold. only divinity can trim the wicks. if we go to someone to rebuke them we will not trim their wick but make it longer. but if we go one with the lord looking to him as we fellowship unconsciously the divine nature will work to trim their wicks.
