according to nt all believers should
be priests:

Rv 1:6
> And made us a kingdom, priests to His God and Father

Rv 5:10
> And have made them a kingdom and priests to our God; and they will reign on the earth.

1P 2:5
> You yourselves also, as living stones, are being built up as a spiritual house into a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.

however the nt does not show _how_ 
to become priests. for that we need
exo 29.

steps:
- washed (for uncleanness)
- clothed (for nakedness)
- redeemed (for sin)
- burnt offerint (for God's satisfaction)
- peace offering (for our hunger, and for our hands to be filled)


the bull, for the sin offering, signifies the crucified Christ. the two rams, for the burnt offering and the peace offerinf, signify the resurrected Christ.
