the second covering is of goats hair. it was made of 11 curtains, a number between 10 and 12
and signifying sinfulness. goat hair is plain, natural, and without beauty. also goats
signify the sinners condemned by God. thus this covering typifies christ who became sin
for us, and also christ who as a man was uncomely outwardly although glorious inwardly.
the second layer protects the first layer by fully covering it. this is christ, protecting
us through his becoming our substitute and being judged on our behalf.

the third covering was rams skins dyed red. this is for redemption.

the fourth covering is porpoise skin for protecting from the attacks of the enemy.
