the lampstand is made all of gold but gold does not burn and thus cannot give
light. for this reason the wicks are needed. however on their own the wicks would
not burn but smoke. thus there is the need for olive oil to saturate the wicks
so that when they burn they give off light.

the tabernacle is the tent of meeting and the lighting of the lamps signify our meetings full of light. in the tabernacle there was no natural light or man made light but only the holy light, the light that comes out of the Triune God and the Spirit of Jesus Christ. our meetings should be full of this kind of light.
