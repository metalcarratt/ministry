the spirit of something is the extract of that
thing. thus the Spirit of God in creation (Gen 1)
is the extract of God, which is God Himself, His
divinity. because creation was through the Spirit
of God, it manifests the eternal power of God.

the first time the term Holy Spirit is used is with the conception of the Lord Jesus. the Holy Spirit is the extract of God's holiness, thus the Lord was called a "holy thing" at His birth. it is also by such a Holy Spirit that we can be sanctified with God's holy nature.

in resurrection the Lord was glorified and all He did in His incarnation, human living, crucifixion and resurrection became compounded in the Spirit. now He is have "the Spirit", the Spirit of Jesus Christ, the "another Comforter", the "Spirit of reality", Who is the extract of all the Lord is and did.
