six verses in the sabbath are inserted after the revelation of the tabernacle and before
the builders began, showing that to work with God we first need to rest with God. the
sabbath was gods seventh day, but man's first day.

exo 31:37b
> ...for in six days Jehovah made heaven and earth, and on the seventh day He rested **and was refreshed**.

God not only rested but was refreshed. he was refreshed by the creation He had made,
especially the man He had made. man was like a refreshing drink to satisfy God as
He rested on the sabbath day
