the ten commandments do not have any mention of Christ or His work of redemption.
for these we have to come to the ordinances. in the ordinances we see the work of 
satan, via murder and lies of which satan is the father and coveting which is the
I dwelling sin. witchcraft shows the work of demons. the altar and sacrifice point 
to christ as our redeemer. christ is portrayed as a slave, as one who was slain accidentally
by us, and as our city of refuge. we also see christ bringing back to us (his enemies)
that which we had lost, relieving us of our burdens, and being our sabbath rest.

need to not to delay to bring the fulness of the harvest and the tears of the grape and oil press to the meetings. the fulness of the harvest is our growth in christ by living in him day by day. the wine press and oil press are the experiecnes of the cross. both of these are for the enjoyment of the saints and the lord, so we should not delay to testify of them in the meetings of the church.
