fellowshipping with god in his presence.

in previous chapters the children of israel enjoyed his provision, but this was the
first time they enjoyed his presence and heard his direct speaking to them.

to enjoy gods presence and hear his speaking, the children of israel had to be sanctified
and in resurrection (the third day). they also had to be holy, respecting the border
of gods holiness.

in Gods presence they gained the knowledge of God. the gained the knowledge of gods
grace, which bore them as on eagles wings. they gained the pattern of the building
and received the law as a testimony of the person of God, who he is.

this fellowship also resulted in them being gods personal possession and peculiar
treasure, a kingdom of priests, and a holy nation.
