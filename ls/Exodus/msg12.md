three stations of gods calling
- the wilderness
- the mountain
- the good land

in the wilderness the children of israel enjoyed the passover, separation from the world, the manna,
the water from the cleft rock, the springs at the palm trees.

at the mountain the children of israel received the revelation of the law and the tabernacle.
they built the tabernacle, which signifies the movable church life. however the mountain
is not the goal - only the good land can be the goal.

the church is built of living stones and only the temple was built of stones, showing
we must be in the good land to build the church as the house of god. the good land is the
all inclusive christ as the spirit. the promise to Abraham was not the manna or the cleft
rock, it was the inheritance in the good land.

to enter the good land:
- needed the ark and the tabernacle, christ and the church
- needed burial in the Jordan to deal with self. the ark was the first to go into the water so we deal with the self by christs crucifixion
- needed the circumcision of the flesh.
