three stations of gods calling
- the wilderness
- the mountain
- the good land

in the wilderness the children of israel enjoyed the passover, separation from the world, the manna,
the water from the cleft rock, the springs at the palm trees.

at the mountain the children of israel received the revelation of the law and the tabernacle.
they built the tabernacle, which signifies the movable church life. however the mountain
is not the goal - only the good land can be the goal.

the church is built of living stones and only the temple was built of stones, showing
we must be in the good land to build the church as the house of god. the good land is the
all inclusive christ as the spirit. the promise to Abraham was not the manna or the cleft
rock, it was the inheritance in the good land.

to enter the good land:
- needed the ark and the tabernacle, christ and the church
- needed burial in the Jordan to deal with self. the ark was the first to go into the water so we deal with the self by christs crucifixion
- needed the circumcision of the flesh.

according to the picture we do not begin to enjoy the riches of the good land until the self and flesh have been dealt with.

> within us we are troubled by the self and the flesh, and above us, in the air, there are the evil powers of darkness. when we bury the self and circumcise the flesh, the powers of darkness in the air will be exposed. the self and the flesh help the evil powers. actually, if we are still in the self and the flesh, the principalities and powers need not do anything to hinder us, for we are already frustrated by the self and the flesh. however, as soon as we deal with the self and the flesh, the powers of darkness will come forth to war against us. then we must learn to fight the spiritual warfare. the spiritual warfare is fought in the good land with the support of the rich produce of christ.

the unique sin of a believer is to not live christ.
