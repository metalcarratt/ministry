the reason the priesthood is mentioned straight after the tabernacle is that actually the
dwelling place of God and the priests are the same. this is proven by 1 Peter 2:5

1P 2:5
> You yourselves also, as living stones, are being built up as a spiritual house into a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.

before we can be a priesthood we need to be a house. this means that as materials for God's building, we need to be built together. only then can we have the priest "hood". it is not enough to have no clergy laity system and have the universal priests. we must be built together to be a priesthood. furthermore, just as if the materials of a house were left withiut being built they would become damaged, but are protected by being built into the house, so is our protection by being built up in the church.

as priests we need to serve in coordination.
