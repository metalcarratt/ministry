the reason the priesthood is mentioned straight after the tabernacle is that actually the
dwelling place of God and the priests are the same. this is proven by 1 Peter 2:5

1P 2:5
> You yourselves also, as living stones, are being built up as a spiritual house into a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.
