drink by calling on the name of the lord. we have been positioned to drink through
baptism. we also need to come to Him, and be thirsty for Him. then we need to call.
this is the way to drink. we can call anywhere and at every time.
if we call on the lord we will have the living faith. the more we call the more we will believe.

the lords table meeting is a meeting to remember and worship the lord. we remember and worship by eating and drinking of him in spirit.
