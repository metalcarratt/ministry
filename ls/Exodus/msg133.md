the sanctification of the priests.

in exo 29:9 the word 'consecrate' 
actually means "fill their hands",
meaning that to serve as priests we
need to have our hands full of Christ.
whenever we come to the meetings we
should not come empty handed. we should
come with something of Christ.

the brethren taught against the clergy laity system, that all believers are priests, but the questiom still remains, how can one be a priest? the priests were separated from the common people because their hands were full of the rich offerings. this qualified them to be priests.
