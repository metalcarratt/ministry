christ is in our spirit but to fully appreciate who and what this one who is in out spirit is,
we need the picture of the ark and the propitiation cover. he is gods testimony, with both human and divine
natures. within him is the law as the testimony. upon him is a crown, the propitiation cover
with the cherubim signifying glory. on this crown man can talk face to face with god. this is because
of the blood of christ shed at the altar, which is brought into the holy of holies and
sprinkled on this propitiation cover.
