God wanted to form an army, so in our natural concept he would want the male life
but in exodus 1-2 he uses the female life. the female life is the dependant life
whereas the male life is the independant life. christ is the real man in the universe.
he is our husband. only he is qualified to be independent.

God is the head of christ and christ is the head of every man. Brothers are the husband
in shadow but christ is the husband in reality. thus while the wife submits to the
husband in shadow the husband submits to christ as the real husband. christ was the same,
being the head of his disciples, but taking God as his head andnkt daring to do
anything apart from God.

> man should not be a male but a "female", one who lives a life of dependence on God. only such a "female" life is useful to God. 

Independence is rebellion to God.

life makes us dependant but knowledge makes us independant.

> God desires that we choose life instead of knowledge.

at 40 Moses acted as an independant male, but at 80 he was dependant on God. only once, when he struck the rock twice did he act independant of god and because of that he did not enter the good land. Moses never considered himself the leader. when the children of israel rebelled against him he did not consider that rebellion against himself but rebellion against God. 

> readers of the bible usually regard Moses as the leader of the children of israel. Moses, however, did not have this concept about himself; he never assumed a position as the leader. when the children of israel rebelled against him, he considered it rebellion against God, not against himself. Moses simply went to the lord and presented the problems to him. in doing so, Moses honored the lord as the head, as the unique male.

> if we all have a healthy fear of independence, there will be no problems in the church life. furthermore, there will be no problems among married couples. all problems in the church life, in married life, and among the saints come from one source, and that source is independence from God.
