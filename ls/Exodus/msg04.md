God wanted to form an army, so in our natural concept he would want the male life
but in exodus 1-2 he uses the female life. the female life is the dependant life
whereas the male life is the independant life. christ is the real man in the universe.
he is our husband. only he is qualified to be independent.

God is the head of christ and christ is the head of every man. Brothers are the husband
in shadow but christ is the husband in reality. thus while the wife submits to the
husband in shadow the husband submits to christ as the real husband. christ was the same,
being the head of his disciples, but taking God as his head andnkt daring to do
anything apart from God.
