the curtains were made of linen (humanity), coloured blue (heavenly), purple (royal) and
scarlet (redemption). embroidered on the curtains were cherubim, signifying God's glory.
the linen was fine (even) and twined (not loose). furthermore the embroidering of the cherubim by a skillful worker signifies the lords skillful work in embroidering his glory into us through many "needles".

the humanity of christ, as a curtain covering the tabernacle, covers and protects everything inside it, including the boards which signify us. we are covered, protected and even embraced by the lords humanity, and under this covering we enjoy the ark, the table, the lampstand and the altar.
