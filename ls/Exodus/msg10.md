four of five aspects of gods calling:

- god dwelling in a thorn bush. God eventually dwelt in a tabernacle with Acacia wood overlaid with gold and fine linen woven with gold. this signifies the transformed humanity. however it is precious to recall how God chose to dwell in even the fallen humanity, the thornbush.
- knowing God
  - as the one who is. no matter how much changes, god always is and always will be. even if we don't experience miracles or encounter some loss, god still is eternally. this should be a great encouragement to us
  - as the god of resurrection.
- three signs
  - rod become a serpent showing anything we depend on apart from the lord is a serpent in disguise
  - hand becoming leprous showing in ourselves we are nothing but sin
  - water becoming blood showing the world is death
- matching and cutting
  - brothers matching, we need to be balanced and adjusted by being with others. let others do what we can do
  - wife's cutting, we need to be cut, circumcised, so that our flesh and natural life are no longer expressed.
