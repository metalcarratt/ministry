in exodus 1 god used the female life to preserve the male life and in exodus 2 he used the
female life to prepare a savior. both moses' mother and pharoahs daughter were used
in this way.

the focus in ch2 is on the female life:
- Moses mother gave birth to him and nurtured him
- Moses sister watched overhim and established the connection with pharoahs daughter
- the female slave of pharoahs daughter fetched the ark holding Moses
- pharoahs daughter rescued Moses, charge his mother to nurse him, made him her son, and named him.

> during critical times, the only life that can be used by God is the female life that stands with God and is dependant on Him.
>
> we are living in a critical time, a time when the female life is urgently needed. anyone who presumes to be a male will become a pharoah. all of us, including the brothers, need to be females. in a critical time such as now, the male life that is independent of god is not useful. only the female life, the life that depends on God, is prevailing. if we see this, we shall have a great appreciation for the female life, the life that is wholly dependant on God.

> today we need the various functions of the female life: the conceiving, bearing and nursing function; the function of watching, recommending and establishing connections; the function of helping and serving; and the function of raising, teaching and training.

Moses was rejected by the male life but appreciated and recommended by the female life when he helped the seven daughters of the priest of Midian. the male life that accepted and perfected Moses was the mature life, but the immature male life rejected him.
