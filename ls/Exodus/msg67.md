man loves to build high towers to boast. the more cultured and sophisticated the society, the taller the tower they like to build.
man loves to build more and more stairs, but the worship of God demands no stairs.
it seems too simple, too unsophisticated and uncultured. but this is gods way. he gives
no ground for man's wisdom, culture or sophistication.
