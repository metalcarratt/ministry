man loves to build high towers to boast. the more cultured and sophisticated the society, the taller the tower they like to build.
man loves to build more and more stairs, but the worship of God demands no stairs.
it seems too simple, too unsophisticated and uncultured. but this is gods way. he gives
no ground for man's wisdom, culture or sophistication in the worship of God.

> at this point i would like to say a word especially to the young people. we do not know how long it will be before the Lord comes back. the recovery may need to continue for many years. when some of you begin to take the lead in the churches, you may think that the lords recovery was brought to this country in a very primitive way. then you msy want to use "tools" to hew stones to beautify the recovery and lift it up. automatically "steps" will be necessary to reach what has been built up in this way. in fact, in the past proposals were made to lift up the recovery in certain ways. some even tried to build a pyramid related to the service groups. but by the lords mercy and grace, this pyramid was demolished. every step leading to the top of the pyramid was torn down. instead, we simply gave everyone the opportunity to serve if they so desired.

> young people, do not bring mans work or mans way into the worship of God. to bring in anything of a human source is to insult the very God we worship. if we study the history of religion and the present situation of christianity, we shall see an abundance of mans work and way. but I repeat, God does not allow these things to have any place in his worship.

not uncovering our nakedness:
> if we remain under christ as our covering when various situations come up or when problems arise and do not exercise our wisdom to deal with them, we shall be covered, and no one will see the shame of our fallen nature.  but the more we exercise our wisdom to make plans and build "steps", the more we shall be exposed. the exposure is shameful and condemned by God.
