the ephod typifies christ and the onyx stones
and breastplate signify the church. the
onyx stones signify the church as the testimony
of christ and the breastplate signifies
the members built up. so the ephod, the stones
and the breastplate together signify Christ
and the church.

the breastplate is connected to the ephod by chains and rings of gold at tbe top, connected to the shoulder plates, and ribbons of blue linen at the bottom. the chains of gold signify Christs divine nature (which is twined and has passed through sufferings) and the rings of gols signify the spirit. by his divinity and nature we are bound to Christ's shoulders and breast. being bound to the breast is for holding us, and is a matter of his love. being bound to the shoulders is for his upholding us and is a matter of strength. thus christ is both willing and capable to hold and uphold us.

the breastplate was also bound to the ephod at the botom woth bands of linen blue, signifying that it is both by Christ's divinity and heavenly humanity that we are bound to him.

after being bound to the high priest the breastplate was borne by the high priest before god as a memorial. this shows that we are not only bound to christ but borne by him before God, and in such a positive way as a testimony.
