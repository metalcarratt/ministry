the veil was made of the same material as the cover, so it signifies christ.
 however the veil was hung on pillars. the pillars were acacia wood overlaid with gold,
 the same as the boards. they also signify the believers, but speical ones, ones who
 are pillars in the house of God. the veil signified first the flesh of Christ and thus his
 incarnation, and second the crucifixion kf christ as the veio was rent when he died. thus
 the pillars bear the testimony of christs death and resurrection.
