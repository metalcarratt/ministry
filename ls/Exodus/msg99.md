the veil was made of the same material as the cover, so it signifies christ.
 however the veil was hung on pillars. the pillars were acacia wood overlaid with gold,
 the same as the boards. thet were also placed in scokets of silver and so they also signify the believers, but speical ones, ones who
 are pillars in the house of God. the veil signified first the flesh of Christ and thus his
 incarnation, and second the crucifixion kf christ as the veio was rent when he died. thus
 the pillars bear the testimony of christs death and resurrection.

 the vei separated man from god b3cause man is flesh. it is not until the flesh is rent that man can come to god. 

 > this illustrates the fact that god will not see us and have fellowship with us or speak with us face to face until our flesh is broken. god loves us and he will supply us with his riches. nevertheless, until our flesh is broken he will not speak to us from the ark. there is a veil separating us, and this veil is the flesh, our fallen being.
