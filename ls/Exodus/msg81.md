the tabeenacle is a type of christ and also the church. as a type of christ we
cannot experience much, and cannot build it. but as the church we can experience
and build it. christ is the ark in the tabernacle and the tabernacle is the dwelling place
and exrension of the ark.

the materials for the building of the tabernacle are of three categories: animal,
plant and mineral. animal is for redemption, plant for life and mineral is for building
and fighting. building is the goal but to get there we need the redeeming and generating.
eventually in the new jerusalem the materials are only mineral.
