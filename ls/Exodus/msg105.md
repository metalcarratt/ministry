the altar has many mysterious aspects which is why it is hard to talk about the
cross. one of these aspects is the grating. the grating was inside the altar
and the wood, fire and sacrifice were placed on this grating. thus the grating was
the main part of the altar. without the grating the altar was empty and had no function.
furthermore the rings for the poles for the moving of the latar were connected to
the grating showing that the grating was necessary for the move of the altar.

the grating being inside the altar signifies that the sufferings christ bore on the
cross were more inward than outward. for example, psalm 22:14 says,

> I am poured out like water, / And all my bones are out of joint. / My heart is like wax; / It is melted within me.

the grating was connected to four rings of bronze which typify the eternal spirit. these rings were the power for the grating to stay in position, without which the grating would not be usable. thus the eternal spirit is the power for the efficacy of christs redemption. the rings are not the sacrifice but they are the power for the sacrifce to be effective. in the same way the redemption is only effective through the eternal spirit. when we preach the gospel, the power to save also depends on our being one with the spirit in speaking to others.
