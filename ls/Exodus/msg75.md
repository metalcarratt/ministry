the pagan tribes were the source of sin for the children of israel. our natural
life is also the source of sin for us. although we cannot drive them out more than
our growth in life, we must recognise that they are the source of sin and have
no compromise with them (make no covenant with them). we also must take the initiative
to drive them out. the the lord will follow.

on our side we must:
- recognise the natural life as the source of sin
- make no compromise with it
- grow in life (by eating the word and drinking the spirit)
- be active-passive to drive the natural life out
- deal with any idols

on the Lord's side, He will:
- bless our food and drink
- taking away all sickness (such as blindness, deafness, dumbness and paralysis)
- granting us multiplication, specifically no miscarriage or barrenness
- fulfill our days (bring us to full maturity)
