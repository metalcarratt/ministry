the pagan tribes were the source of sin for the children of israel. our natural
life is also the source of sin for us. although we cannot drive them out more than
our growth in life, we must recognise that they are the source of sin and have
no compromise with them (make no covenant with them). we also must take the initiative
to drive them out. the the lord will follow.
