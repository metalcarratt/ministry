only the divine nature as the golden pot can hold our hidden portion of Christ.

the manna placed before the testimony shows that the manna meets gods requirements of his nature, primarily that of holiness, righteousness, love and light. when we eat christ has the manna, the christ who gets preserved in the divine nature within us fulfills all the requirements of gods testimony within us.

eating christ as the manna fulfills the requirements of the law of life within us. it also makes us overcomers. while the church goes the way of the world the overcomers stay in the holy of holies enjoying christ as the hidden manna.

if the eating of manna by the children of israel is a miracle, surely our eating christ as the manna today is a miracle. we are enjoying the deeper miracles found in the hidden manna.

the rules of manna are completely up to god. whether we gather little or much we only gather one omer. if we try to gather more it will get worms. it needs to be baked to be eaten but if left in the sun melts. but on the sixth day it won't melt or get worms, neither will it when in the golden pot. all this shows the manna is something miraculous and of god, for it does not follow the natural laws.
