only the divine nature as the golden pot can hold our hidden portion of Christ.

the manna placed before the testimony shows that the manna meets gods requirements of his nature, primarily that of holiness, righteousness, love and light. when we eat christ has the manna, the christ who gets preserved in the divine nature within us fulfills all the requirements of gods testimony within us.
