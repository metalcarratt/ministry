as the thummim Christ is thw completor.
in our experience there is always something
lacking. even when we come to the church
we will find there is still something
lacking of Christ. therefore we meed more
of Christ added to us to complete ua.

the more we experience the more we realise
how little we have expwrienced. we need
the transformation into precious stones and
the inscribing. how little we have. but even
then we need more. we need to keep experiencing
Christ so that he can complete us.
