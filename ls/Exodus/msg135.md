without the types in the ot it is hard
to see how we can serve God as priests.

According to the picture in exodus, the way for us to become priesta and serv Him is not to be "ordained" or have some kind of consecration, but to be "sanctified", which literally means to "have our hands filled" with the rich offerings.

> the priests need to have their hands filled in order to serve God. their hands should be filled with the fat of the ram of the peace offering, bread, cakes and wafers. when a priest has his hands filled with the sweetness and riches of Christ, he is different from others. they are empty handed but he has his hands filled. as a result he is sanctified, set apart, from common people. furthermore he has the riches of Christ with which to serve God as a priest.

to be a priest we need:
- to be washed in the word and clothed with christ as our covering
- have the ram for redemption and the breads, cakes and wafer for life generation
- have the sin offering as a continual warning and reminder that we have a sinful life
