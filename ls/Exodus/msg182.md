ch 35 - 39 is on the actual making of the tabernacle, furniture and garments. this
chapter begins with a serious word on the sabbath, that working on the sabbath was
a crime punishable by death and even cooking was not allowed.

not leaving anything of the feast of the passover until the morning. we must enjoy christ to the utmost today, we need to exhaust the portion of christ we have for us to experience today. there is a portion given for us to enjoy each day, and we need to enjoy all of it, not being like naughty children who do not finish their dinner.

Ex 34:25b
> nor shall the sacrifice of the Feast of the Passover remain all night until the morning.

> if we would enjoy christ, we need to fulfill the five conditions. we need to be replaced by christ, we need to clear away all leaven, we need to exhaust our present portion of christ, we need to bring the topmost experience or christ to the church meeting and offer it to God, and we need to keep death away from the sphere of nourishing life.

the sabbath being mentioned in exo 35 before the work of the tabernacle began shows that we need to rest in the Lord before we work. for example before we take a walk, or before we write a letter, we can pray, "Lord, be with me as I do this. I rest in You and do this with You." this is to rest throughout the day, and to rest before we work.
