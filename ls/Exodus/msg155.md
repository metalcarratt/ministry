the silver accomplished two things: it contributed
to the building of the tabernacle, and it formed
an army to fight for God's interest on earth.

although silver is related to redemption there is
no blood, so it does not signify the crucified
Christ. rather this silver was a heave offering,
which signifies the ascended Christ. this is the
highest experience of Christ.

we all need to reach the spiritual age of twenty
so we can be drafted to fight in the army.
