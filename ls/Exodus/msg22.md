not only was moses used by god but pharoah too. god even made him stand to resist
his judgement. not even nebuchadnezzar was as strong as pharoah in resisting gods
will. this was gods soveriegnty so that he could show forth his power and declare
his name. if pharoah had suddenly died before the end of the 12 conflicts, god would
have lost this opportunity.

> not only was moses useful to the lord, but pharoah was useful also. can you believe that pharoah also was useful to the lord? ... if pharoah had suddenly died after the first or second conflict, moses' job would have been cut short, and god would have losthis opportunity to show forth his power and to declare his name. hence, god needed pharoah, and he needed him to stand throughout the twelve conflicts. god made pharoah strong to stand throughout these conflicts in order that his purpose might be fulfilled.
