not only was moses used by god but pharoah too. god even made him stand to resist
his judgement. not even nebuchadnezzar was as strong as pharoah in resisting gods
will. this was gods soveriegnty so that he could show forth his power and declare
his name. if pharoah had suddenly died before the end of the 12 conflicts, god would
have lost this opportunity.

regarding gods sovereignty over pharoah:

> not only was moses useful to the lord, but pharoah was useful also. can you believe that pharoah also was useful to the lord? ... if pharoah had suddenly died after the first or second conflict, moses' job would have been cut short, and god would have losthis opportunity to show forth his power and to declare his name. hence, god needed pharoah, and he needed him to stand throughout the twelve conflicts. god made pharoah strong to stand throughout these conflicts in order that his purpose might be fulfilled.

regarding knowing gods mercy through his soverignty:

> we need to worship God for his sovereignty. we should say, "Lord, I worship you for your sovereignty because your sovereignty reflects your mercy. lord, I am weak and sinful. sometimes I am even rebellious. but I thank you lord that my heart has been softened and is always willing to repent. lord, I thank you for giving me such a soft heart." if you do not know that you should worship God for his sovereignty, you may not realise his mercy to you. but if you know gods soveriegnty you will thank him for his mercy. you will realise, even as you come to the meetings of the church, that you are under the lords soveriegn mercy. consider how many people are involved with sinful things or worldly things. but we desire to come together in the lords presence to listen to his word to seek what is on his heart, and to practice being one with him. this is according to gods sovereignty mercy. praise him that we are under his sovereign mercy.
>
> it is of the lords mercy that we can attend the church meetings. many of us can testify that the happiest nights of the week are the meeting nights. if there were no meetings to attend, what would we do with all our time? in our free time we would be miserable. praise the lord that, according to his sovereign mercy, we can come together in the meetings!
>
> the more we recognise gods sovereignty, the more grateful we shall be for his mercy. hallelujah, gods mercy has been sovereignly bestowed upon us! by his mercy, we are not stubborn like pharoah! sometimes we may be stubborn, but in the lords sovereign grace, we can be stubborn only for a short while. then we repent, either to the lord or one we have wronged. this desire to repent is the lords mercy to us.

regarding working for god:

> in the conflicts between god and pharoah we can also learn the proper way to work for god. the proper way is not to labour or endeavor, but to represent him. just as moses was sent by god, so we also must be sent by him.
