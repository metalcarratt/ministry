not only was moses used by god but pharoah too. god even made him stand to resist
his judgement. not even nebuchadnezzar was as strong as pharoah in resisting gods
will. this was gods soveriegnty so that he could show forth his power and declare
his name. if pharoah had suddenly died before the end of the 12 conflicts, god would
have lost this opportunity.
