we need to see gods soveriegnty (so that we do not boast), but also take up our
responsibility (not using gods sovereignty as an excuse). then we need to guard
our hearts not to allow negative things to develop between us and God. this is a matter
of our free will. if we allow negative things to develop, god might not extend his
mercy toward us. therefore, while his mercy is extended toward us, our heart should be
soft and open toward him and not allow anything to come in to harden us.
