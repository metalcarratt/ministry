in 2 cor 5 paup talks about two types of reconciliation: christ's reconciling the
world to himself, and the word of reconciliation he had toward the believers. these
two reconciliations match the veil and screen in the tabernacle. reconciliation is to remove the barriers between us and God. the first reconciliation
removed part of the barrier, but there still remains another barrier between us and God,
which is our flesh. the second ministry of reconciliation is to bring the believers back to
God in the Holy of Holies.

paul uses several metaphors to descrive the holy of holies:
- being captives in christs procession
- being incense bearers of the fragrance of christ
- being letters inscribed with the spirit of the living god
- being unveiled mirrors beholding and reflecting the glory of the lord
- being earthen vessels within which is a glorious treasure
- being photgraphs upon whose hearts god has shone his glory upon

once we have tasted life in the holies we will never want to return to the holy place or outer court.
