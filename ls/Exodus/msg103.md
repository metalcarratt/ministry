in 2 cor 5 paup talks about two types of reconciliation: christ's reconciling the
world to himself, and the word of reconciliation he had toward the believers. these
two reconciliations match the veil and screen in the tabernacle. the first reconciliation
brings sinners into the holy place, but there is still a barrier between us and God,
which is our flesh. the second ministry of reconciliation is to bring the believers back to
God in the Holy of Holies.
