because moses was discouraged after talking to pharoah god had to have a further training
of moses. in addition to reiterating his name and the covenant he had made with abraham,
isaac andjacob, he covered six points:
- gods repeated word of assurance
- learning to expect disbelief in the children of israel, the ones to whom he was sent
- pharoahs stubbornness
- moses' natural concept regarding his speaking ability, rather than trusting in God's word of assurance
- gods ordination of moses
- gods strong hand, which backs his name, his covenant, and his word of assurance.
