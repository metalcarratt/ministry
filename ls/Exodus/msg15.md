because moses was discouraged after talking to pharoah god had to have a further training
of moses. he covered eight points:
- gods name
- gods covenant made with abraham, isaac and jacob
- gods repeated word of assurance
- learning to expect disbelief in the children of israel, the ones to whom he was sent
- pharoahs stubbornness
- moses' natural concept regarding his speaking ability, rather than trusting in God's word of assurance
- gods ordination of moses
- gods strong hand, which backs his name, his covenant, and his word of assurance.
