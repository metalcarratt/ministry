because moses was discouraged after talking to pharoah god had to have a further training
of moses. he covered eight points:
- gods name
- gods covenant made with abraham, isaac and jacob
- gods repeated word of assurance
- learning to expect disbelief in the children of israel, the ones to whom he was sent
- pharoahs stubbornness
- moses' natural concept regarding his speaking ability, rather than trusting in God's word of assurance
- gods ordination of moses
- gods strong hand, which backs his name, his covenant, and his word of assurance.

### word of assurance

> Therefore say to the children of Israel, I am Jehovah, and I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians, and I will deliver you from their bondage, and I will redeem you with an outstretched arm and with great acts of judgment.
> 
> And I will take you to Myself as My people, and I will be your God; and you shall know that I am Jehovah your God, the One who brought you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians.

Exo. 6:6-7

the lord has promised that he will build his church. we should not believe in any negative situation but in the lords promise and in his word of assurance.

moses complained to God that his words had no power before pharoah or the elders of Israel.
