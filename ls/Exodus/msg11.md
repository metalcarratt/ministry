> God is still seeking to deliver his chosen people out of the usurping hand of satan and out of the tyranny of the world. as gods called ones we need a clear view of what the world is. the world is not a source of enjoyment; it is a place of tyranny. in the world satan is keeping gods chosen people, those destined for the fulfillment of God's purpose, under his usurping hand.

it is somewhat easy to preach to people but not easy to deliver them from the world. as gods called ones one aspect of our purpose is to bring others out of the tyranny and usurpation of the world.

> we must pray that our ministry of the word will have impact. we do not want to give mere knowledge to people. rather, we desire that something in our preaching will touch their hearts and cause then to leave the world and journey into the wilderness in resurrection.

gods purpose in calling us is to:
- rescue his people from the world
- bring them into the wilderness in resurrection
- bring then to the mountain
- build the tabernacle
- enter the good land and build the temple

our greatest shortage is living christ. we focus on many things such asbeing victorious or spiritual but not living christ. for a christian to not live christ is a sin. we may ask how do we live christ? because we pursue other things such as being victorious we find it hard to live christ.

the tribes of Canaan are a type of the evil principalities in the air which we must defeat in order to enjoy christ as the good land.
