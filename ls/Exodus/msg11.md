> God is still seeking to deliver his chosen people out of the usurping hand of satan and out of the tyranny of the world. as gods called ones we need a clear view of what the world is. the world is not a source of enjoyment; it is a place of tyranny. in the world satan is keeping gods chosen people, those destined for the fulfillment of God's purpose, under his usurping hand.

it is somewhat easy to preach to people but not easy to deliver them from the world. as gods called ones one aspect of our purpose is to bring others out of the tyranny and usurpation of the world.
