we meed to realise we have a sinful
nature and that it will never go away.
part of the sin offering (the fat and other
pieces) were burned on the altar for God's
satisfaction. but certain parts (skin,
bones, dung) were burned up outside the
camp. this is for judgment. christ was
judged, condemned, even forsaken, for us.

the washing of water deals with our
outward defilement but the sin offering
deals with our inward sin. we should
never think our sinful nature will go
away, and must always be on guard against
it. we also need to enjoy the sin offering
before we can enjoy any of the othwr
offerings which are our food.
