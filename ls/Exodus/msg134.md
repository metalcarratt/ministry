we meed to realise we have a sinful
nature and that it will never go away.
part of the sin offering (the fat and other
pieces) were burned on the altar for God's
satisfaction. but certain parts (skin,
bones, dung) were burned up outside the
camp. this is for judgment. christ was
judged, condemned, even forsaken, for us.

the washing of water deals with our
outward defilement but the sin offering
deals with our inward sin. we should
never think our sinful nature will go
away, and must always be on guard against
it. we also need to enjoy the sin offering
before we can enjoy any of the othwr
offerings which are our food (ram, wafers, cakes, bread).

if we enjoy Christ aa the sin offering we will not be able to argue with others because we will be conscious of our sin. if we do not enjoy christ as our sin offwring we will be empty inside and it will be hard to function as a priest during the day. this is a part of the secret to feed on Christ.
