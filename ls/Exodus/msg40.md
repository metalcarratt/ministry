first was the manna, christ in the word as our life supply, second is the water
flowing out of the cleft rock. this order is the same in john, bread then water.
but in revelation the order is reversed, with the tree in the river.

the cleft rock is the clearest picture of the crucifixion of christ.

drinking is more necessary than eating for our existence.
