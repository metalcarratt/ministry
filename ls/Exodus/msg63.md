> this matter of telling the lord thatwe love him and his word, but that we are not able to do what the bible says is surely not a natural concept or a religious concept. however, it is according to gods economy. ... if you say this 
to the lord, you will have the conviction deep within that even though you cannot fulfill this requirement, the lord will do it in you and through you. as long as you love the lord and his word and as long as you stay with him, he will do in you what you cannot do in yourself.

> "Lord i love the word and I love you. but lord you know that I cant do what the bible says. now I know that whatever you tell me to do, you will do for me. I know what is on your heart. you have no intention for me to do anything. although you tell me to do certain things, your desire is that you do these things in me. you simply want me to love You and stay with you. the more it stay with you, love you, and tell you that I cannot do anything, the happier you are."
