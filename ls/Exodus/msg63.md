> this matter of telling the lord thatwe love him and his word, but that we are not able to do what the bible says is surely not a natural concept or a religious concept. however, it is according to gods economy. ... if you say this 
to the lord, you will have the conviction deep within that even though you cannot fulfill this requirement, the lord will do it in you and through you. as long as you love the lord and his word and as long as you stay with him, he will do in you what you cannot do in yourself.

> "Lord i love the word and I love you. but lord you know that I cant do what the bible says. now I know that whatever you tell me to do, you will do for me. I know what is on your heart. you have no intention for me to do anything. although you tell me to do certain things, your desire is that you do these things in me. you simply want me to love You and stay with you. the more it stay with you, love you, and tell you that I cannot do anything, the happier you are."

the negative function of the law: to expose us, subdued us until we become humble, and to guard us unto Christ.

> the concept of doing things for god is a fallen human concept. it is also a religious concept. after god created man, god did not charge him to do many things for him. instead, he gave man a commandments related to his eating. god placed the man created by him in front of the tree of life and warned him not to eat of the tree of knowledge of good and evil.


> in the book of Genesis god did not appear for the purpose of telling man what to do. instead god came again and again to make promises, promises which indicate that gods intention was to do everything for man. on our part we should simply turn to Him, seek him, love him, be one with him, and stand with him in his interest. then he will do everything for us.


> our responsibility is to love him, receive him, stay with him, and spend time with him so that he can infuse himself into us. do not worry about fulfilling gods requirement. simply open and receive him.
