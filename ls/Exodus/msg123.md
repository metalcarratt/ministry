the breastplate signifies the church
and is the same as the ephod in
materials and workmanship. this shows
that the church is the same in
constituent amd formation as Christ.

the breastplate is a span in width
and height, showing it can fit within the lords hand.

Jn 10:28
> And I give to them eternal life, and they shall by no means perish forever, and no one shall snatch them out of My hand.

we have no excuse to not be the lords testimony, since no situation can exceed the lords care.
