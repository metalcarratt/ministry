problems of our heart that prevent us from receiving help and blessing when we come to the word:
- not exercising our heart when we come to the word
- our heart divided between the word and wanting something else
- having no heart for the word at all
- possessed by some sin
- not getting through on a matter with the Lord

when we come to the word we need to humble ourselves to deal with anything between us and the Lord. we should not assume our heart is so clean that there is nothing blocking or covering our fellowship with him.

we should also humble ourselves not to trust ourselves, not to have confidence in ourselves, not insisting on anything, and asking for his mercy. then we will receive light.

with the light comes life. when we come to the word and our condition is proper the word becomes light in thr understanding of our soul. but when we pray this light goes deeper, into out spirit, and becomes life.
