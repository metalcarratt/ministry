> Daily we are under God's testing. The kind of life we have at home, at work, and at school is subject to God's test. What a brother says to his wife will be tested by God, and the attitude of a young person toward his teachers and classmates at school will also be tested. God will even test our motives, intentions, and all that is in our heart. As we experience God"s testing, we gain not older gold and silver, but also bronze. This causes us to be a different kind of person, a person who is not careless about the way he behaves, speaks and expresses his attitudes. A person who experiences the bronze is a person under the cross, under God's test.
