in Gods eyes, worshipping him is to enjoy a feast unto him. he likes to see his people feasting and enjoying him.

the feasting is a sacrifice. the children of israel ate what they had sacrificed. for example after sacrificing the passover lamb they ate it.

a pharoah is one who keeps people from feasting and enjoying the lord. Satan is a pharoah but we may also be a pharoah to one another and even to ourselves.

to have a feast requires a large number of people to come together. our life of feasting in the church life requires we come together with many others.

pharoah increased their work, called them idle, and accused them of listening to "vain" words. in the world people are working for their existence but neglecting the purpose of their existence. but while we need to exist we need a certain "idleness" to feast before the Lord. when need to come to the church meetings to be "idle" and listen to the "vain" words of the Lord.

the things necessary need to be under a divine limitation. we need a place to live and we need to keep it clean, but these things should not keep us from feasting to the lord and listening to his word.

> out living and existence depend on the provision from the heavenly source, not the supply from the world. for this we need the vision, and we need the exercise of faith. moses was a man of great faith to lead two million people out of Egypt into the wilderness, where there was no earthly supply for their human existence.
