in Gods eyes, worshipping him is to enjoy a feast unto him. he likes to see his people feasting and enjoying him.

the feasting is a sacrifice. the children of israel ate what they had sacrificed. for example after sacrificing the passover lamb they ate it.

a pharoah is one who keeps people from feasting and enjoying the lord. Satan is a pharoah but we may also be a pharoah to one another and even to ourselves.

to have a feast requires a large number of people to come together. our life of feasting in the church life requires we come together with many others.
