1 john 2:22 warns against the doctrine that jesus is not the christ and denying the father
and son. this is to try and separate the father, son and spirit, which is heresy and
comes from trying to systematize the trinity.

22-25 talk about the father, son and eterna life. these three are compounded in the spirit, which is the ointment in 20 and 27. the anointing teaches us concerning "all things". these things are the truth of the trinity.
