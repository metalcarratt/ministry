a different side to the experience of a believer that in Genesis. exodus shows us a picture of redemption which Genesis does not. this is the passover lamb. even the way the lamb was killed is a picture of the cross, as the lamb was attached to two crossed wooden bars and then slain.

exodus also shows us how God cares for the needs of his people, through the manna and the smitten rock, how he leads gods people through the pillars of cloud and fire, how he dwells among gods people through the tabernacle, and finally how he cares for his people corporately, not just individually.

the glory of God is unique to exodus, filling the tabernacle.

even with the fall, while Genesis showed a coming out of idolatrous babylon, exodus shows a coming out of worldy Egypt with all its pleasures and fleshly enjoyment, and the accompanying slavery and bondage.
