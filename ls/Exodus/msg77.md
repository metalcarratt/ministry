> after listening to a particular message, we may pray, "lord, i make up my kind to live according to this message. pleaze help me carry out my decision." this kind of prayer exposes the fact that we are still under the influence of the natural, religous concept. it takes a long time to be fully free from this influence. ... however if we are enlightened by the Lord, we would no longer make up our mind to do what he requires. instead, we would pray, "Lord, have mercy on me, for I am not able to do what you require. Lord, I praise You that You have redeemed me and terminated me and that You are in the process of replacing me with Yourself and making me Your reflection."
