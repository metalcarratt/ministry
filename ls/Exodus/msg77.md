> after listening to a particular message, we may pray, "lord, i make up my kind to live according to this message. pleaze help me carry out my decision." this kind of prayer exposes the fact that we are still under the influence of the natural, religous concept. it takes a long time to be fully free from this influence. ... however if we are enlightened by the Lord, we would no longer make up our mind to do what he requires. instead, we would pray, "Lord, have mercy on me, for I am not able to do what you require. Lord, I praise You that You have redeemed me and terminated me and that You are in the process of replacing me with Yourself and making me Your reflection."

the new covenant promised in the old testament:
- Jeremiah 31:33
- Ezekiel 36:26-27

Je 31:31-34
> Indeed, days are coming, declares Jehovah, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah,
> Not like the covenant which I made with their fathers in the day I took them by their hand to bring them out from the land of Egypt, My covenant which they broke, although I was their Husband, declares Jehovah.
> But this is the covenant which I will make with the house of Israel after those days, declares Jehovah: I will put My law in their inward parts and write it upon their hearts; and I will be their God, and they will be My people.
> And they will no longer teach, each man his neighbor and each man his brother, saying, Know Jehovah; for all of them will know Me, from the little one among them even to the great one among them, declares Jehovah, for I will forgive their iniquity, and their sin I will remember no more.

Ezk 36:26-27
> I will also give you a new heart, and a new spirit I will put within you; and I will take away the heart of stone out of your flesh, and I will give you a heart of flesh.
> And I will put My Spirit within you and cause you to walk in My statutes, and My ordinances you shall keep and do.
