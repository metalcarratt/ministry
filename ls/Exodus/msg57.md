muse upon the word - deeper than pray-reading, it includes prayer, worship, enjoyment, conversation, bowing down, lifting our hands to receive the word, rejoicing, praising, shouting and weeping over the word.

2. considering it
3. esteeming it right in all things
4. entering into it
5. learning it
6. treasuring it
7. hiding it in their heart and not forgetting it
8. standing in awe of it
9. cleaving to it

11. turning their feet unto it
