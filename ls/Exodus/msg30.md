even the geographical features of the world were arranged by god in his creation to serve his purpose in
rescuing his people and fulfilling a type. God deliberately arranged the red sea for the
children of israel to serve as a baptistry for them after they were led out of Egypt.
furthermore, he placed Marah a three days journey away (and lead them to take a pace of
three days) to signify that after baptism we are in resurrection (3=resurrection).
the wilderness is a type of resurrection because, in the world's eyes, after we receive
the lord we enter a wilderness without garlic and leeks. but in our eyes it is a realm of
resurrection.

at marah the bitter waters were made sweet by the cross of christ. when we are in resurrection the water of the world can no longer satisfy us. only when we enjoy the cross can we be satisfied. not only that, he heals us. our mind, emotion and will and even our spirit is sick and needs healing. the cross not only makes our bitter situation sweet but heals us.
