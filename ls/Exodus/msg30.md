even the geographical features of the world were arranged by god in his creation to serve his purpose in
rescuing his people and fulfilling a type. God deliberately arranged the red sea for the
children of israel to serve as a baptistry for them after they were led out of Egypt.
furthermore, he placed Marah a three days journey away (and lead them to take a pace of
three days) to signify that after baptism we are in resurrection (3=resurrection).
the wilderness is a type of resurrection because, in the world's eyes, after we receive
the lord we enter a wilderness without garlic and leeks. but in our eyes it is a realm of
resurrection.
