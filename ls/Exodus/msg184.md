it is not an easy matter for God to reach us. on the one hand is almighty and
sovereign, but on the other hand He is not lawless. He is a God of law, regulation
and order. He is also holy and righteous. He must behave according tonl His nature,
which requires a number of steps for Him to come to us, and for us to come to Him.
these steps include the bronze altar, the table and lampstand, and the incense altar.

our concern is our salvation, which is the altar, but God's concnern is His testimony, which is the ark.
