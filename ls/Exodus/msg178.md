in His promise to bring the children of Israel into the good land, the Lord gave
a warning against idolatry. idolatry keeps us from enjoying the all-inclusive Christ
as the good land. whenever enemies came to attack it was almost always because of
idolatry. God is willing and able to bring us into the enjoyment of the all-inclusive
Christ, but we need to guard ourselves from idols so that we don't lose this enjoyment
or fail to enter into it properly.
