god gave moses three signs to prove that he was a called one. they are the staff turning
to a snake, the hand on the chest being leprous, and the water poured out being blood.
these three signs signify that the called one needs to know how to deal with Satan, with
the flesh which is sin, and with the world which is death.

the rod is anything we rely upon. it could be our job, our education, or our marriage. anything we rely on could be a hiding place for the serpent. we need to cast it down temporarily to see it's true nature and grab it again by the tail, turning it on its head. it's not that we don't use these things, but that he don't grasp it by the head but by the tail.

our flesh is leprous. we must know that our flesh is the incarnation of rottenness, corruption, uncleanness, and sin. it is the very embodiment of sin. cleansing comes by keeping (obeying) the word of the lord.
