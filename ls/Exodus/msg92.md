the lampstand. a picture of the triune God. gold is the nature of God the Father.
the shape, form is the Son. the seven lamps are the Spirit of God. the lampstand
in exodus becomes the seven churches in revelation as the reproduction of the Triune
God.

the lampstand in the tabernacle signifies Christ as the light of life. he is light
and as light he comes out of life. experientially, it is after enjoying him as the 
bread of the presence that we enjoy him as the light of life. as with the table of
the presence, this can only be enjoyed in the church, by those who are built up
with others.

the lampstand being of pure gold means that christ being tbe light of life is purely a matter of his divinity.

since aarons rod bodded with almonds the almond blossom signifies resurrection. it is also the first flower to blossom. signifying the firstfruits of resurrection. the light of life comes only in the divinity of God and in the resurrection life.

> suppose in your daily life with your family you are shining with the divine light. suddenly, however, you revert to your natural life and begin to speak and behave in a natural way, especially in your relationships with the members of your family. immediately, your blossoming buds collapse and you stop shining. because you have lost the calyxes as the support of the blossom buds, there is no more shining. when you remain in resurrection, you are blossoming, shining. but when you leave resurrection and return to your natural life, you immediately stop shining. you may have been shining a few minutes ago, but now, having lost the support of resurrection life, you are no longer shining. whenever the calyx, the support of the blossoming bud, is removed, the flower collapses and falls. thus, because there is no blossoming there is no shining. the shining of the divine light is held by the resurrection life.
