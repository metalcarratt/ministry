the lampstand. a picture of the triune God. gold is the nature of God the Father.
the shape, form is the Son. the seven lamps are the Spirit of God. the lampstand
in exodus becomes the seven churches in revelation as the reproduction of the Triune
God.

the lampstand in the tabernacle signifies Christ as the light of life. he is light
and as light he comes out of life. experientially, it is after enjoying him as the 
bread of the presence that we enjoy him as the light of life. as with the table of
the presence, this can only be enjoyed in the church, by those who are built up
with others.

the lampstand being of pure gold means that christ being tbe light of life is purely a matter of his divinity.
