pharoah was stubborn but moses went back again and again to negotiate with him. maybe
we would give up after a few times if our gospel contact was stubborn, but we need to
be patient and persevering.

God hardened pharaohs heart. many times he allows Satan to act to use him. we can see this in job, where he even has access to heaven.

whether the pillar is light to us or darkness depends on whether we are following gods people or attacking them.

```
when we are attacked, we may be tempted by the enemy to doubt our way of standing. but during such times of doubt, the light we have received is our confirmation. this is the protecting light.
