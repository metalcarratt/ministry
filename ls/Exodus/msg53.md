gods giving of the law was his engagement contract with his people. especially with
the first five commandments, each was given in an attitude of love.
- with the first he says he is "jehovah their god" and reminds them how he delivered them from bondage and told them to have no other gods beside him, clearly a word as a husband requiring his wife to have no other lovers beside himself.
- with the second he requires them to have no images, similar to how a man would not want his wife to hold pictures of someone other than himself.
- with the second he also requires them not to bow down or serve other gods, being jealous over them, as a husband would be jealous over his wife
- in the second he also talks of giving mercy to those who love him, showing that as a bachelor he is seeking someone to love him, and that as the eternal god his mercy would extend eternally to those who love him.
- in the third he commands not to take his name in vain, as a beloved wanting his name to be honored and used in a proper way
- in the fourth he gives the sabbath as a sign of his engagement. as a holy day, the sabbath is a sign of our sanctification, a visible symbol of those who have been separated unto him.
- in the fifth he asked them to honour their parents, whose source is traced back to God.
