gods giving of the law was his engagement contract with his people. especially with
the first five commandments, each was given in an attitude of love.
- with the first he says he is "jehovah their god" and reminds them how he delivered them from bondage and told them to have no other gods beside him, clearly a word as a husband requiring his wife to have no other lovers beside himself.
- with the second he requires them to have no images, similar to how a man would not want his wife to hold pictures of someone other than himself.
- with the second he also requires them not to bow down or serve other gods, being jealous over them, as a husband would be jealous over his wife
- in the second he also talks of giving mercy to those who love him, showing that as a bachelor he is seeking someone to love him, and that as the eternal god his mercy would extend eternally to those who love him.
- in the third he commands not to take his name in vain, as a beloved wanting his name to be honored and used in a proper way
- in the fourth he gives the sabbath as a sign of his engagement. as a holy day, the sabbath is a sign of our sanctification, like an engagement ring, a visible symbol of those who have been separated unto him.
- in the fifth he asked them to honour their parents, whose source is traced back to God.

> revealing himself as a jealous god, he requested that they have no other god, no other beloved, besides him. he was seeking their love so that they would keep his commandments to express him. ... the commandments in 20:1-12 were given not in a legal way, but in a courting way. in giving his law to his people, god wanted them to become his lovers.
