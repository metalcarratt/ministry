the emphasis on the passover and the feast of unleavened bread is on eating. this signifies
that the most important thing is what we eat, because we live by what we eat. if we
do not eat we will not be able to live.

unleavened bread. leaven is sin. it is also anything that makes something hard easier to take. for example, joking may make a hard situation easier to take.

no leaven should be seen - it is impossible to deal with all sin, but we should deal with any sin that is manifested. to eat the feast of unleavened bread is to constantly deal with sin by eating the Lord. if we do not deal with sin we will lose the enjoyment of the feast.

on the first and last day of the feast the lord commanded the children of israel not to do anything but eat. God's principle is eat first and then work. we should eat more than we work. we need to eat more and work less.
