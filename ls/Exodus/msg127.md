except for moses, with whom God spoke
face to face as with a friend, God
spoke to Joshua and those after Him
through the urim and thummim via the
high priest.

the high priest through whom God would
speak had certain qualifications. according
to deut. 33:8-9 this one had to be godly
by not allowing the members of their
family to become a separation between
them and God. this is similar to the
lord's word in matt 10:37 about not loving
the relatives above him.

Dt 33:9
> He who said of his father and mother, / I do not regard him; / And his brothers he did not acknowledge, / And his children he did not recognize; / For they have kept Your speaking / And have guarded Your covenant.

Mt 10:37
> He who loves father or mother above Me is not worthy of Me; and he who loves son or daughter above Me is not worthy of Me;

another qualification was to be one who offered burnt offerings and incense on the altars

Dt 33:10
> They shall show Jacob Your ordinances, / And Israel Your law; / They shall put incense before Your nostrils / And whole burnt offerings upon Your altar.
