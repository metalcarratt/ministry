the children of Israel enjoyed the passover lamb,
the manna and the living water before the tabernacle
was built and the preisthood was prepared. this
show that even before the revelation of the tabernacle
and the priesthood there qas some enjoyment. most
christians today are here, before the revelation.
however only those who have God's dwelling place
and the priesthood can enjoy the compound ointment.
you may experience the oil - the uncompounder Spirit,
but can have no share in the compounded ointment,
the compound Spirit.
