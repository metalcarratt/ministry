the children of Israel enjoyed the passover lamb,
the manna and the living water before the tabernacle
was built and the preisthood was prepared. this
show that even before the revelation of the tabernacle
and the priesthood there qas some enjoyment. most
christians today are here, before the revelation.
however only those who have God's dwelling place
and the priesthood can enjoy the compound ointment.
you may experience the oil - the uncompounder Spirit,
but can have no share in the compounded ointment,
the compound Spirit.

we need to consider, why did the lord reveal a compound, not just oil which typifies the Spirit, and why did He reveal this only after the building of the tabernacle and the preparation of the priesthood.

the numbers three and five are related to Gods building. both noahs ark, the tabernacle, and its furnishings contain the numbers three and five. this is not an accident.

the bible is like a cypher. we need to know how to decypher it in order to understand it.
