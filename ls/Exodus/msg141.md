the cleaning of the priests, clothing him and
feeding him were not just for the priest to be
filled. God also wants something to eat. part
of the peace offering was for the priest but other
parts were for God. the burnt offering was wholly
for God.

the food that was offered to God includes: the bull,
two rams, fine flour, oil and wine.

the bull was for the sin offering. sins are related
to our behaviour, but sin to our nature. even
if we have done nothing wrong we still need the
sin offering for we are sin by nature. the sin offering
was offered every day of the seven days of the
priests purification. this means that we need
to enjoy christ as our sin offering daily.
