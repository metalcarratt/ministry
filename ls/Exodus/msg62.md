Paul says the law is holy and good (Rom 7:12) and spiritual (Rom 7:14). the law is
out from God, and is therefore the same nature as He is.

Moses stayed with God on the mountain for forty days doing nothing but being infused with God. when he came down from the mountain his face was shining from being infused. this is what we need. it's often hard for us to stay in God's presence without doing anything but this is how we need to come to the Word. the children of israel wanted to do something for God but God only wanted to infuse himself into them. many people come to the bible looking for commandments, of which there are many, but few come purely to be infused by spending time in God's presence.
