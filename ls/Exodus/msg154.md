the redemption silver was for those qualified to 
be in the army. everyone was qualified for the
redemption of the lamb but to be redeemed for the l
army requires the spiritual growth unti maturity.

the army was also only for males. spiritually, males aignifies the stronger ones. therefore whether we are brothers or sisters we are males if we are spiritually stronger.

as we spend time at the incense altar, motivated more for God's interests than our own, we realise the need for the formation of an army to fight for God's interests on the earth. silver signifies the Christ who has been experienced by the saints as the resurrection and ascension and are now mature enough to go to war. this silver is then paid to make the sockets that hold the sanctuary and the veil. this is the base of the whole tabernacle.
