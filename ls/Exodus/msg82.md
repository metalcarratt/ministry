the title 'exodus' is not adequate to describe this book because it concludes not
with the exodus from egypt but with the building up of gods dwelling place.

the material god uses is the christ who has been experienced by us. we need to
pursue, gain, and possess christ in our experience. then in the meetings when we
praise the lord we offer the christ we have experienced as a heave offering to the
lord.

> we have pointed out that the high priest wore a breastplate made of precious materials when he came into God"s presence. if we experience Christ as the building materials and put Him on as the breastplate when we come into God's presence, we shall receive God"s revelation.

Those who are still in high school should not think that they are too young to present such a heave offering to God for His building. I can testify that when  the young people function in this way I am edified and built up.
