the title 'exodus' is not adequate to describe this book because it concludes not
with the exodus from egypt but with the building up of gods dwelling place.

the material god uses is the christ who has been experienced by us. we need to
pursue, gain, and possess christ in our experience. then in the meetings when we
praise the lord we offer the christ we have experienced as a heave offering to the
lord.
