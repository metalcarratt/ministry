God sent the Angel of Jehovah to bring the children of Israel into the good land.

Ex 23:20
> I am now sending an Angel before you to keep you in the way and to bring you into the place which I have prepared.

Ex 23:23
> For My Angel will go before you and bring you to the Amorites and the Hittites and the Perizzites and the Canaanites, the Hivites and the Jebusites; and I will cut them off.
