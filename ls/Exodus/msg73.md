God sent the Angel of Jehovah to bring the children of Israel into the good land.

Ex 23:20
> I am now sending an Angel before you to keep you in the way and to bring you into the place which I have prepared.

Ex 23:23
> For My Angel will go before you and bring you to the Amorites and the Hittites and the Perizzites and the Canaanites, the Hivites and the Jebusites; and I will cut them off.

the good land is the ultimate type of the all inclusive christ. the borders of the good land are seas, rivers and the wilderness, all which signify situations of death and barrenness, showing that outside Christ is only death.

furthermore there are many tribes in the land, and these tribes have idols and behind the idols are demons. the demons are spiritual forces preventing us from enjoying the riches of the good land christ.

> as Christians we experienced losing our temper even when we did not want to do so. there was something, some kind of force, which caused us to lose our temper involuntarily. this indicates that the aspects of our natural life are utilized, manipulated, and directed by spiritual forces behind the scene. the aspects of the natural life with the spiritual forces behind them frustrate us from the enjoyment of the riches of the all-inclusive Christ.
