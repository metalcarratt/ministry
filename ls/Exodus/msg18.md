the reason god is able to withhold his judgement upon creation is because of the
redemption of christ. at the time of Adam, Adam as the head of creation rebelled against
God. at that point the universe should have collapsed since God cannot tolerate
rebellion. however he chose to view the whole old creation under the redemption of
christ. the redemption of christ occurred before the foundation of the world in God's reckoning.
thus he was able to spare the old creation for the sake of his purpose. not only
believers but unbelievers today enjoy the benefit of christs redemption because it
has enabled God to postpone his judgment upon the earth while he seeks to bring many
to believe into him.

if the earth and water are under christs redemption to us, then it will produce crops and fish, but if it is not it will produce lice, frogs and blood.

> I can testify from a pure conscience that the water I enjoy produces fish and not frogs. furthermore, for me the earth produces corn, wheat and vegetables; it does not produce lice. however, if in your experience the earth is not under Christ's redemption, the dust of the earth will become lice.

the swarms of flies in the air signifies the moral atmosphere in the world, which is polluted, filled with all kinds of unclean and evil things.

the pestilence was upon the unclean animals (camels, horses, asses) used for transport, and upon the clean animals (ox, sheep) used for food. this shows that transport and food were judged.

the plagues enlightened gods people to the true nature of life in Egypt and also motivated them to get out of Egypt and go into the wilderness.
