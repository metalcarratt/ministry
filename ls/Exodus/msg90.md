the sequence in exodus is different from our experience. in exodus the ark
is first and then the showbread table.

the matter of the table comes immediately after the ark, showing they are connected.
the ark is for God's testimony but the table is for our nourishment. when we enjoy gods presence in the holy of holies the ark becomes a table to nourish us.

the bread on the table was in the holy place. thus it was only for the priests 5o enjoy. unlike the manna which could be enjoyed by anyone, this bread is only for those who enoy gods presence at the ark.

the bread of the presence is the bread eaten in the presence of God. it is the bread eatn in the tabernacle, which is the builded saints, before the ark as the testimony of God. if we are not built with the saints, not in the church, and not in God's presence, we cannot enjoy this bread. receiving supply to overcome sin or the flesh is an experience of manna, but not of the bread of the presence.
