the bible is a book on eating and drinking. genesis, revelation and john all strongly
emphasise this.

eaitng and drinking the lord are not metaphors, they are facts. we can often water down
the bible. Paul says the rock which followed them was christ. he said it was a spiritual
rock flowing with spiritual water. these are not metaphors but facts.

when we eat and drink something it gets into us, becomes one with us, and becomes the
tissues and fibres of our being.
