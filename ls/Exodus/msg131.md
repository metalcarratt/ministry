exo 28:36-43 is the final word on the
preistly garments, and includes the turban,
the girdle, the tunic, the breeches, and
the golden plate. the golden plate was
all gold and was inscribed with the words
"holiness to jehovah". the other items
were of fine linen, which according to rev. 19:8
is the righteousnesses of the saints. so
the two most impressive points about the
priestly garments is holiness and righteousness.
holiness is of the divine nature, amd thus golden.
righteousness is the sum total of human
virtue and thus linen.
