the incense altar is the last item of furniture
of the tabernacle to be revealed. it is not spoken
of until after all the furniture, the tabernacle
itself, the outer court, the priestly garments and
the priestly food have been unveiled. after all
these things the priests were ready to begin their
service. but their service began not with the bronze
altar in the outer court, but with the golden incense
altar.
