the incense altar is the last item of furniture
of the tabernacle to be revealed. it is not spoken
of until after all the furniture, the tabernacle
itself, the outer court, the priestly garments and
the priestly food have been unveiled. after all
these things the priests were ready to begin their
service. but their service began not with the bronze
altar in the outer court, but with the golden incense
altar.

the tabernacle with all its furnishings is a picture of the entire bible, and the book that is most representative of this is the gospel of john:
- ch1 speaks of creation, "all things came into being through him"
- 1:14 shows christ himself is the tabernacle
- 1:29 shows He is the lamb of God, pointing to the bronze altar
- ch3 talks of the washing of regeneration, the laver
- ch6 talks of the showbread table, "the bread of god is he.."
- 8:12, "i am the light of the world" - the lampstand
- ch 14, 15, 16 show the holy of holies
- ch 17 reveals the prayer at the incense altar.
