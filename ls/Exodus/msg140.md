God would mever fill the hands of someone who
is naked. to have our hands filled we meed to
clothed with the priestly garments. similarily
he would not anoint such a one with the spirit
of power. thoae on pentecostalism seek the anointing
of the spirit, but if we are properly clothed we
will experience the anointing automatically.
