God would mever fill the hands of someone who
is naked. to have our hands filled we meed to
clothed with the priestly garments. similarily
he would not anoint such a one with the spirit
of power. thoae on pentecostalism seek the anointing
of the spirit, but if we are properly clothed we
will experience the anointing automatically.

the priests had to wear the garments seven days before they could serve. this means we need to live christ every day in order to function in the meetings. we cannot turn up at the lords table meeting and expect to function if we have not been experiencing and enjoying the lord for the full week before that.

the portion for God had to be burned because God can only enjoy what has passed through judgment, but what the priests enjoyed could be boiled.

the produce of the good land could be enjoyed anywhere, signifying that we are free to enjoy Christ in any place. however the top ten percent could only be enjoyed at the feasts, in Zion. of this top ten percent, the second ram of the peace offering could only be enjoyed by God at the tent of meeting. this shows that the top most enjoyment of Christ can only be enjoyed in the meetings of the church
