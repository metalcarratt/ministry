god gave the law to reveal what kind of person he is. in Genesis 1:26 image and
likeness are used positively, showing god made man in his image with his likeness.
in exodus 20:4 image and likeness are used negatively, showing god does not want us
to bear any other image or likeness (which is idolatry) apart from him. this shows
that the ten commandments are related to gods image and likeness.
