god gave the law to reveal what kind of person he is. in Genesis 1:26 image and
likeness are used positively, showing god made man in his image with his likeness.
in exodus 20:4 image and likeness are used negatively, showing god does not want us
to bear any other image or likeness (which is idolatry) apart from him. this shows
that the ten commandments are related to gods image and likeness.

prior to exodus 20 god revealed himself as perfect, almighty and all sufficient, but not until this chapter did he adequately reveal what kind of god he is. he did
this indirectly through the law.

10 commandments also called the ten words.

jealous - contray to our concept that god is broad minded, he calls himself a jealous god.
we should not allow anything else to be a god to us.
