golden incense altar.

if we consider a picture of the tabernacle we see the altar of burnt offering at one end and the ark at the other. thr outer court symbolises the earth and the tabernacle symbolises heaven. the record of the tabernacle starts from gods end and proceeds toward man, but for man if we want to come to god we are first met with the latar. one day christ, journeyed from heaven to the ewrth to come to the bronze altar and die for our sins.

chris5 jiurneyed from the ark to the latar with the purpose of bringing us to the ark. but many christians are stuck around the altar. 

the position of the incense altar changes based on our experience. sometimes in a meeting we may be very close to god, in the holy of holies. other times we are further away, in the holy place.
