the altar of burnt offering.

if we consider a picture of the tabernacle we see the altar of burnt offering at one end and the ark at the other. thr outer court symbolises the earth and the tabernacle symbolises heaven. the record of the tabernacle starts from gods end and proceeds toward man, but for man if we want to come to god we are first met with the latar. one day christ, journeyed from heaven to the ewrth to come to the bronze altar and die for our sins.

chris5 jiurneyed from the ark to the latar with the purpose of bringing us to the ark. but many christians are stuck around the altar. 

the position of the incense altar changes based on our experience. sometimes in a meeting we may be very close to god, in the holy of holies. other times we are further away, in the holy place.

the altar of burnt offering was much larger than the other furniture, able 5o fit all of them inside. this means that the altar is the base and source for all the other experiences.

the altar was made of acacia wood overlaid with bronze. christ was offerwd on the altar. twchnically it is not the altar that is the wacrficie but that which is offerwd upon it. si.ilarily it is not the cross as a means of roman execution that sav3s us but the person who died for us on that croas. for thos reason the altar was made of acacia wood to point at the perfect humanity of the one who sacrific3d himself on the cross. the effectiv3ness of the cross is in this one.
