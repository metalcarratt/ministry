to take possession of the good land is synonymous with wining christ, gaining christ, obtaining christ, laying yold of christ, grasping christ, in Philippians.

in exodus 23:20-33 we see mainly not the details of the land but the frustrations to entering the land and the way to posses theland.

frustrations:
1. Not obeying the indwelling Lord, and thus provoking Him.
2. not cooperating with the Lord to cut off the pagan tribes - first we need to grow for we cannot be vacant, second we need to cooperate to deal with the natural life.
