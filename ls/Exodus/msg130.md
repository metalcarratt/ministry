the robe worn by the high priest

Is 6:1
> In the year that King Uzziah died I saw the Lord sitting on a high and lofty throne, and the train of His robe filled the temple.

the train signifies the lords virtues. the more
someone covers themselvea the more virtue
he has. the lords virtue is so great it fills
the temple he is sitting in.
