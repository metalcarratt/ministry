the robe worn by the high priest

Is 6:1
> In the year that King Uzziah died I saw the Lord sitting on a high and lofty throne, and the train of His robe filled the temple.

the train signifies the lords virtues. the more
someone covers themselvea the more virtue
he has. the lords virtue is so great it fills
the temple he is sitting in.

Ps 133:2
> It is like the fine oil upon the head / That ran down upon the beard, / Upon Aaronâ€™s beard, / That ran down upon the hem of his garments;

Rv 1:13
> And in the midst of the lampstands One like the Son of Man, clothed with a garment reaching to the feet, and girded about at the breasts with a golden girdle.
