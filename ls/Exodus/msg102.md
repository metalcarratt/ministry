Christ presented in the four gospels was a screen. he kept out all the negative things
(such as the pharisees) and wouldnt allow sinners to enter unless they repented and
believed in Him. if a sinner believed Christ as the screen would become an entrance
through which a sinner can come in to the house of God to enjoy Him.
