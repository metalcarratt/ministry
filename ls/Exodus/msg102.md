Christ presented in the four gospels was a screen. he kept out all the negative things
(such as the pharisees) and wouldnt allow sinners to enter unless they repented and
believed in Him. if a sinner believed Christ as the screen would become an entrance
through which a sinner can come in to the house of God to enjoy Him.

although Christ is the screen as the entrance, where can people today find him? it is only through the pillars who bear him as a testimony that people are able to find him as the entrance. this is what happened with the 120 on the day of pentecost.

the beginning of the book of acts is a picture of many believers in the holy place after having been saved. for example the murmuring that followed the communal living showed that the believers were still in the flesh and thus hadn't passed into the holy of holies. however Paul and his coworkers were pillars both of the screen and the veil. in pauls epistles he especially labours to bring the saints into the holy of holies.
