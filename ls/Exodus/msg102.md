Christ presented in the four gospels was a screen. he kept out all the negative things
(such as the pharisees) and wouldnt allow sinners to enter unless they repented and
believed in Him. if a sinner believed Christ as the screen would become an entrance
through which a sinner can come in to the house of God to enjoy Him.

although Christ is the screen as the entrance, where can people today find him? it is only through the pillars who bear him as a testimony that people are able to find him as the entrance. this is what happened with the 120 on the day of pentecost.
