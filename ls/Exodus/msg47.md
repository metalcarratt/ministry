satan is signified by pharaoh, the world by egypt and the flesh by amalek. all of 
these are the enemies of god. after these three enemies are dealt with the kingdom
will come in.

rom 8:7, "the mind set on the flesh is enmity against God; for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can it be."

> the flesh is ugly for the simple reason that it is not subject to the law of God.

to battle against the flesh we need the intercession of our heavenly high priest, as well as our prayer to support his intercession. we also need Aaron (representing the priesthood) and hur (representing the kingship) to sustain our prayer.

> sometimes our praying hands become heavy not because we lack the desire to pray, but because we are lacking in incentive and encouragement. this means that we may be in need of Aaron and Hur, in need of the priesthood and the kingship.
