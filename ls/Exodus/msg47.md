satan is signified by pharaoh, the world by egypt and the flesh by amalek. all of 
these are the enemies of god. after these three enemies are dealt with the kingdom
will come in.

rom 8:7, "the mind set on the flesh is enmity against God; for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can it be."

> the flesh is ugly for the simple reason that it is not subject to the law of God.

to battle against the flesh we need the intercession of our heavenly high priest, as well as our prayer to support his intercession. we also need Aaron (representing the priesthood) and hur (representing the kingship) to sustain our prayer.

> sometimes our praying hands become heavy not because we lack the desire to pray, but because we are lacking in incentive and encouragement. this means that we may be in need of Aaron and Hur, in need of the priesthood and the kingship.

- sometimes we sense heaviness in our prayer. the reason may be an issue with the priesthood, which is conducted in the holy of holies, in our spirit. if we do not deal with our spirit we will not be able to pray.

- other times the reason is rebellion against the kingship. if we are disobedient we may need to deal with this before we can pray.

- thirdly our prayer should be toward the building (hours grandson was given skill in constructing the tabernacle).

if we deal with these three matters we will be able to pray to war against the flesh.

moses also sat on a rock. this rock is our realisation that in ourselves we cannot pray unceasingly, and only the christ in us can do it.
