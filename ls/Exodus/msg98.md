the standing power of the boards is the acacia wood. furthermore the boards were placed
into silver sockets with tenons. silver signifies the redemption of christ. the tenons
should be our faith, which needs to be doubled in order to stand properly. this means
we should bieve and have doubt at the same time but believe absolutely.

we need to believ3 absoultely what the bible says. we might say we sometimes dont have faith but we question is actually our experience rather then the lord.
