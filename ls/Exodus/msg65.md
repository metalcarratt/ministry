moses put a veil on his face when he spoke with the children of israel. the reason
is because they had a hard heart, hard like pharaoh. in 2 cor paul says the veil was the
hearts of the people. it was their hardened heart which has turned away from the lord. their hardened heart caused the ministry of glory to be veiled and even become a ministry of condemnation and death. in the same way, the gospel, which is a word of righteousness, spirit and life, will become condemnation to those who do not receive it.

if our heart is right we will receive blessing when we hear his word. but if we are indifferent it will cause our heart to be hardened and there will be a veil.

we are mirrors. when the veil covers us the law is only condemnation to us. but when the veil is removed we can behold the lord and reflect him.

whether we are in the ot or the nt experientially depends on our heart. if our heart is veiled we are in the ot. if our heart is turned to the lord and unveiled we are in the nt.

> 2Co 3:14But their thoughts were hardened; for until the present day the same veil remains at the reading of the old covenant, it not being unveiled to them that the veil is being done away with in Christ.

> 2Co 3:15Indeed unto this day, whenever Moses is read, a veil lies on their heart;

> 2Co 3:16But whenever their heart turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away.

> 2Co 3:17And the Lord is the Spirit; and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.

> 2Co 3:18But we all with unveiled face, beholding and reflecting like a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit.
