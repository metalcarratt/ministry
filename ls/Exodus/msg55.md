if you read and pray read the song of songs you will become romantic with the Lord, beside ourself in love for him.

all the commandments are verified throughout the whole Bible. to lay them aside is to lay aside the whole Bible. even the matter of the sabbath has not been laid aside. while we do not keepthe seventh day, we do keep the eight, because we are a people in resurrection. so the principle has remained the same.

although we do not abandoning the law we also should not misuse it. we must take the law, as well as the whole Bible, in the way of love. otherwise, whether the bible or the law, we will misuse and abuse it.
