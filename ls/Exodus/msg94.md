the lampstand is a tree. first christ grows to the bottom two branches and then branches
out while continuing to grow upward. then he grows to the second two and thrid two
before completing the trunk. there are 25 calyxes and 21? blossoms, indicating that
growth is more important, more basic, than shining.

there are three types of light. in the outer court is the natural light. in the holy place
is the lampstand and in the holy of holies is gods glory. the lampstand is a light in
the tabernacle, in the church. outside the church is only natural light, not christ as the light 
of life.

when we come into thw holy place we enjoy life and snuff out the charred wicks (deal with the natural life) and eventually come to enjoy resurrection life at the golden incense altar.
