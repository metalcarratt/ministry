the cloud covered the tent of meeting and the glory filled the tabernacle. the tent
of meeting and the tabernacle were the same but the denotation is slightly different.
from our perspective it is the tent of meeting but from God's persepctive it is the
tabernacle. originally the tent of meeting was Moses' tent when he moved his tent
outside the camp. we may have the experience of the tent of meeting outside the camp
with the cloud covering us, but this experience is still somewhat outward. we need to
go deeper to experience the tabernacle filled with the glory of God.
