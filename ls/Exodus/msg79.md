the blood is not only for redemption but for the enacting of the new covenant, with
all its promises.

Mt 26:28
> For this is My blood of the covenant, which is being poured out for many for forgiveness of sins.

this blood first fulfilled the passover lamb in Exodus 12 for redemption. the lord then
took this blood to enact the covenant, fulfilling exodus 24. finally this blood open
the new and living way into the holy of holies fulfilling leviticus 16.

through the blood:
- we are redeemed
- we enjoy the tree of life (rev 22:14)
- we enjoy the rivers of water of life (rev 7:14, 17)
- we are brought into the holy of holies (heb 10:19-20) where we enjoy:
  - a new heart (nature) (ezek 36:26)
  - a new spirit
  - God's Spirit in our spirit
  - the inward law of life (jer 31:33)
  - knowing God (jer 31:34)
- we serve the living god (heb 9:14)
- we are brought into the temple to enjoy god for eternity (rev 7:15-16)

> the blood of the covenant is not mainly for forgiveness; it is primatily for God to be our portion.
