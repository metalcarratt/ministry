once the flesh is dealt with the kingdom comes in. "the flesh lusts against the spirit, and the
spirit against the flesh" (gal 5:17), those who practice such things will not inherit the
kingdom of God (v21)

four words in gal 5:17-25, flesh, cross, spirit, kingdom. we can colour them in our Bible with black (flesh), red (cross), green (spirit, life), yellow (kingdom). if we do this we will have much revelation.
