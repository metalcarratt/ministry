once the flesh is dealt with the kingdom comes in. "the flesh lusts against the spirit, and the
spirit against the flesh" (gal 5:17), those who practice such things will not inherit the
kingdom of God (v21)

four words in gal 5:17-25, flesh, cross, spirit, kingdom. we can colour them in our Bible with black (flesh), red (cross), green (spirit, life), yellow (kingdom). if we do this we will have much revelation.

jethros proposal show that in the kingdom everything should be maintained in a proper order. there should be "captains", ones who remind others of the spirit and the cross, to help maintain the proper order in the church.
