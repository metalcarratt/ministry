according to the divine revelation
in the nt the lord has two natures:
divine and human. yet it is mot clear
in the nt how these two natures are
combined. does the human nature wrap
the divine nature, or are they placed
side by side? according to the picture
in exodus, they are interwoven like fine
threads. furthermore, the gold went
through a process to becomw thread.
the gold first had to be refined to
be made pure. then it had to be beaten
into sheets and cut into threads, and
finally woven together with the linen.
our lord alsp didnt just become a man.
he was conceived in a womb, grew up as a
boy and lived as a man in a poor home
full of human sufferings.
