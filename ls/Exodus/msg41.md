the children of israel saw all gods marvelous acts but didnt know his ways. they had 
seen the signs in Egypt, had the passover, been delivered from egypt, passed through the 
red sea, been to marrah and the seventy palms. they had the manna. but they complained
again about their thirst. we shouldn't condemn them for we are exactly the same. when
we should be praising the lord and trusting in him we are complaining.
