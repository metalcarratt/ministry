the children of israel saw all gods marvelous acts but didnt know his ways. they had 
seen the signs in Egypt, had the passover, been delivered from egypt, passed through the 
red sea, been to marrah and the seventy palms. they had the manna. but they complained
again about their thirst. we shouldn't condemn them for we are exactly the same. when
we should be praising the lord and trusting in him we are complaining.

> if the children of israel had known the ways of god they would not have quarreled with moses or tested the lord. rather, they would have realise that their deliverance from egypt was not initiated or carried out by them. it was wholly gods doing, carried out on his initiative. God sent Moses to the people to tell them that he would do everything necessary to bring them out of egypt and into the wilderness where they would serve the lord. the people would then have remembered that in egypt they had seen gods mighty acts. this should have given them the assurance that God would meet all their needs. they would also have understood that they were not in the present situation by their own choice, but by the lords leading. the Lord led them there, and he was present with them, as indicated by the pillar which stood between heaven and earth. 

massah means tried, tested, tempted, proved. Medinah means quarreling, strife. at both places the people tested God and god tested moses and the people. only god passed the test. 

> God tested the people by purposely guiding them by the pillar to a dry place. after leading the people to a place without water god was silent and did nothing for a period of time. if he had immediately provided living water the people would not have been exposed. in order to expose the people, god deliberately refrained from acting to quench their thirst. this put them to the test.
