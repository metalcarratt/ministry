> with the tabernacle and the court of the tabernacle, there are two aspects of God's expression. Outwardly, God's expression is righteousness, signified by the linen. Inwardly, God's expression is holiness, signified by the gold. How can we enter into the realm, the sphere of God's righteousness? We enter into this realm only by passing through the gate of God's judgment, where everything related to us is judged. Then we are qualified to bear God's righteousness as His expression.

Jn 16:8
> And when He comes, He will convict the world concerning sin and concerning righteousness and concerning judgment

this judgment is exercised in a positive way, that people may be saved. when we repent we place ourselves under the judgment of God.
