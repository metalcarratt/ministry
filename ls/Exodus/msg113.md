> with the tabernacle and the court of the tabernacle, there are two aspects of God's expression. Outwardly, God's expression is righteousness, signified by the linen. Inwardly, God's expression is holiness, signified by the gold. How can we enter into the realm, the sphere of God's righteousness? We enter into this realm only by passing through the gate of God's judgment, where everything related to us is judged. Then we are qualified to bear God's righteousness as His expression.

Jn 16:8
> And when He comes, He will convict the world concerning sin and concerning righteousness and concerning judgment

this judgment is exercised in a positive way, that people may be saved. when we repent we place ourselves under the judgment of God.

both in married life and in the church life we need to live under God's judgment. then we will have peace.

> in the church life we also need to be under God's judgment. if we justify ourselves, we shall not be able to stay in the church life. the more I justify myself, the more I shall condemn others. eventually, I shall leave the church. those whp justify themselves and condemn others are not able to stay with others. in the church God's way is the way of judgment.
