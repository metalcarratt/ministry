the "groceries" for producing food for God was
two lambs, and amount of fine flour, wine and oil.
Christ is the lamb and the wheat, the vine producing
grapes and the olive tree producing oil. however
these ingredients were not objective to the iraelites
but subjective, because each of these items came
out of their labour upon the good land.

to grow Christ as the vegetable life and to raise Christ as the animal life, we need to live Christ. for example, to have the bull for the sin offering, every day we need to experience Him as our sin offering in the morning. the more we do this, the more christ as the sin offering bull will grow in us. we will become more and more conscious of our being sin and our need for such an offering. even in the meetings of the church we will offer prayers thanking the lord for being our sin offering. this shows that the christ we have grown as a bull is now being presented to him at the tent of meeting to be his food.

> in the meetings of the church we must have the proper content. we should not have empty shouting, shouting voic of content or reality. it is not sufficient merely to function in the meetings in an active way or a so-called living way. we need spiritual content. this content requires that daily we grow Christ and raise Christ.
