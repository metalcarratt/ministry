christ is our passover. for the children of israel it was the blood that covered them
for the angel of death to pass over them, but for us it is christ himself. in Genesis
redemption is signified by first the coats god covered Adam and eve with, then the offering
of Abel, then Noah in the ark. in exodus christ is typified by the house. this is why the
new Testament says repeatedly that we are in christ. it is because we are in christ as
the house that gods judgement passes over us.
