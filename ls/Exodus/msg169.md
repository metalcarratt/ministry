the spices. the first three signify the death of Christ, the last signifies the
resurrection of Christ.
- stacte: a type of myrrh signifying the sweet death of Christ. the root of the word means, 'drop', and the gum has the appearance of tears as it comes out, signifying the suffering of the lord on earth.
- onycha: the shell of a snail that grows in the marshes of the red sea. it signifies the living of Christ in a marshy world, redeeming us
- galbanum: another gum with a very strong and unpleasant fragrance that strengthened and lengthened the potency of the other spices. it was also a repellant to serpents and insects.
- frankincense: signifies resurrection and is also full of the number five (the number of the kind of trees it comes from, the number of petals, stamens and pistels on the flowers), signifying responsibility.

of the three spices that signify Christ's death, the first signifies Christ died to
generate many sons, the second that He died to redeem sinners, and the third that He
died to destroy the devil.

"not for mans smelling" means we pray to the lord, not for others to hear.
