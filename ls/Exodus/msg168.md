the incense was three spices (stacte, onycha, and galbanum), plus frankincense and
salt. with the ointment, God coming to us, there is no need of salt, for God is
pure. however with the incense, us going to God, there is the need of salt to purify
us through killing.

in our serving together and in our married life we need salt. this salt is the salt of the covenant:

Lev 2:13
> you shall not omit the salt of the covenant of your God from your meal offering

Num 19:18
> It is a covenant of salt forever before Jehovah for you and for your descendants with you.

to experience the christian life in a finer way our prayer must be salted.

when we are young we realise we cannot prayer without dealing with our sins, but as we grow in the lord we realise our prayer cannot be easily acceptable or fragrant to the lord if we have some king of motive or intention in our heart, or if our spirit is biased. for this we need the killing of the cross as the salt to purify our motive and intention and spirit.

> do you intend to pray? as you are about to pray, you need to be crossed out. your natural being, your natural way, your natural thought, your natural desire, your natural preference, your natural choice--all must be crossed.
