eating the quails was for the satisfaction of the flesh, eating the manna is for the
heavenly life supply. when the quails were sent they were sent without restraint. but
with the manna there was much restraint. for example, they had to gather it in the morning,
and not gather too much. they could not gather in a greedy way. on the sabbath they could
not gather at all, but had to gather twice as much on the sixth day. all these show that
to eat manna is to be according to god.

> eating quails makes people wild and unrestricted, but eating manna regulates them and causes them to be according to God.
