people can commit suicide by many different
means but you cannot crucify yourself. Gal 5:25
(they who are of christ jesus have crucified the
flesh) does not mean we can crucify ourselves.
Rom. 8:13 (if by the spirit you put to death the
practices of the body), show that to put
our flesh to death is by the Spirit, not by
ourselves.

the ointment contains the numbers three and five, numbers related to Gods building. this shows that the element of God's building is also an ingredient of the compound Spirit. three is the triune God and five is man bearing responsibility.
