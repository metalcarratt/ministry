people can commit suicide by many different
means but you cannot crucify yourself. Gal 5:25
(they who are of christ jesus have crucified the
flesh) does not mean we can crucify ourselves.
Rom. 8:13 (if by the spirit you put to death the
practices of the body), show that to put
our flesh to death is by the Spirit, not by
ourselves.
