> whenever we are not satisfied with christ and not supplied by the life-giving spirit, we are subdued under the flesh. but whenever we rise up and enjoy christ as our manna and drink of the life-giving spirit as the living water, we are no longer subdued by the flesh.

> before we began to enjoy christ as our food and the life-giving spirit as our living water, we did not have any consciousness that the flesh was fighting against us. 

the flesh is destructive and warlike. (amalek means warlike). amalek was a son of esau, the older brother of Jacob. this shows how close the flesh is to us, and that it is even the first man, having been born first.
