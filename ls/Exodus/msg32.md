after the experience at elim the children of israel murmured because of the lust of
the flesh in relation to eating. we cannot rely on the experience of the living water
to deal with the flesh and its lust. for this reason we need the daily nourishment of
the food supply (the manna).

> although the flesh may be dealt with repeatedly, even hundreds of times, it is still with us. however, whenever we are satisfied with christ as the heavenly life supply, the flesh with its lust is conquered. but whenever we are short of christ as our nourishment, the flesh will be exposed once again.
