there were six items in the garments worn by the priests:
- the breastplate
- the ephod
- the robe
- the tunic
- the turban
- the girdle

each signify a different expression of Christ.

similar to a policeman, the garment of the priest:
- qualified him to serve as a priest
- sanctified him, separating him as unique from other people

Ex 28:2
> And you shall make holy garments for Aaron your brother, for glory and for beauty.

glory is the divinity signified by gold, amd beauty is the lords humanity signified by fine linen. on the priests clothing these two were intertwined signifying that Christ expressed a glorious divinity finely interwoven with a beautiful humanity, and this living is to be our expression.
