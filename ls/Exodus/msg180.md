five pre-requisites for feasting and resting with the lord.

1. redeeming a donkey with a lamb. our natural life is a donkey, unclean, and needs the redemption of a lamb. this means our natural life, no matter how good it is, needs to be replaced by Christ.
2.  not offering the blood of the sacrifice with leavened bread. we should not proclaim we are redeemed and then live a sinful life. we need to enjoy the feast of unleavened bread, to purge out all sinful things in our life. otherwise we cannot enjoy the feast.
3.  do not leave the passover to the morning. enjoy christ today, now, not leaving it to the next age or to a future time.
