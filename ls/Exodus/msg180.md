five pre-requisites for feasting and resting with the lord.

1. redeeming a donkey with a lamb. our natural life is a donkey, unclean, and needs the redemption of a lamb. this means our natural life, no matter how good it is, needs to be replaced by Christ.
2.  not offering the blood of the sacrifice with leavened bread. we should not proclaim we are redeemed and then live a sinful life. we need to enjoy the feast of unleavened bread, to purge out all sinful things in our life. otherwise we cannot enjoy the feast.
3.  do not leave the passover to the morning. enjoy christ today, now, not leaving it to the next age or to a future time.
4.  bringing the firstfruits to the house of God. bringing our topmost enjoyment to the church meetings.
5.  not boiling a kid in its mothers milk. not killing the young believers with the word of God, the things of life.

in recovering the covenant God gave these five things rather than repeating the ten commandments. this is because it was not his intention for us to keep the law. but rather by feasting on and resting in the Lord, to live Him out automatically.
