the master builder was Bezalel, the son of Uri, the son of Hur. Bezalel means
"in the shadow of God", Uri means "light of Jehovah", and Hur means "free, noble, white".
to be a master builder we need to be hidden under God's shadow, protected from the enemy,
under His light, and also noble, clean and pure.

Bezalel was also filled with the Spirit of God in knowledge, understanding, wisdom
and workmanship. first we need knowledge, to know many things. then we need to understand
how these things relate and work together. finally we need wisdom to apply this
knowledge and understanding. to be an elder requires much widsom, not only to
understand a situation but to know how to care for different ones.
