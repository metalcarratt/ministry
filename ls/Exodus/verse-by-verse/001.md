# 1. Enslaved in Egypt

## 1:1-6 Continuation of Genesis
This book is a continuation of Genesis. Genesis has a good begininning but a poor ending, but Exodus has a poor begining but an excellent ending.

> **1** Now these are the names of the sons of Israel who came to Egypt with Jacob; each man came with his household:
>
> **2** Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah,
>
> **3** Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin,
>
> **4** Dan and Naphtali, Gad and Asher.
>
> **5** And all the persons who came forth from the loins of Jacob were seventy persons, but Joseph was already in Egypt.
>
> **6** And Joseph died, and all his brothers, and all that generation.
