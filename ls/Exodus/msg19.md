pharoah was exceptional in resisting god. any other person would have given up earlier
but he was stubborn even after his first born died. this was gods sovereignty to allow
his people, and the egyptians themselves, to clearly see what life is like in the world.

it is easy to hate sin but not the world. sin is against gods righteousness, but the world is against his holiness, which is higher than his righteousness. thus loving the world is worse than sin.

> do you love things such as frogs, lice, flies, pestilence, locusts, and darkness? certainly not! however, you may love them unknowingly because you do not see them for what they really are. for example, you may think that the blood is water or that the lice are dust. only when you see into the true nature of things in the world will you stop loving them.
