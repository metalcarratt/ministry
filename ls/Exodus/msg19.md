pharoah was exceptional in resisting god. any other person would have given up earlier
but he was stubborn even after his first born died. this was gods sovereignty to allow
his people, and the egyptians themselves, to clearly see what life is like in the world.

> God used pharoah to educate the Egyptians, the children of israel, and his people throughout
> the generations. the church people today need to learn from these chapters in exodus
> the nature, significance, and result of the life of the world and God's attitude toward
> such a life. only by receiving such a revelation can we truly hate the worldly life.
