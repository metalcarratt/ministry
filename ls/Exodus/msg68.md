exodus 21-23 are ordinances concerning our relationship with man. the first ordinance
is related to slavery. we need to ask why. the reason is, that to keep the law we
first need to love God, and we second need to have the spirit of a slave. the lord himself
came to earth humbling himself, in the form of a slave and being obedient unto death.

> the only one who can fulfill all the ordinances of the law is one who is willing to be a slave. a slave does not stand on his own rights. he only knows to serve and to sacrifice, not to care for his own interests. a slave must always be concerned for others.
