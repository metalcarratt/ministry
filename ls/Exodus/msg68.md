exodus 21-23 are ordinances concerning our relationship with man. the first ordinance
is related to slavery. we need to ask why. the reason is, that to keep the law we
first need to love God, and we second need to have the spirit of a slave. the lord himself
came to earth humbling himself, in the form of a slave and being obedient unto death.

> the only one who can fulfill all the ordinances of the law is one who is willing to be a slave. a slave does not stand on his own rights. he only knows to serve and to sacrifice, not to care for his own interests. a slave must always be concerned for others.

if all the israelites had had the attitude of a slave, not caring for their rights, their society would have been like heaven on earth. love is the fulfillment of the law.

Mk 12:30-31
> And you shall love the Lord your God from your whole heart and from your whole soul and from your whole mind and from your whole strength.” The second is this: “You shall love your neighbor as yourself.” There is no other commandment greater than these.

Rm 13:8
> Owe nothing to anyone except to love one another; for he who loves the other has fulfilled the law.

Rm 13:10
> Love does not work evil to his neighbor; therefore love is the fulfillment of the law.

Ga 5:14
> For the whole law is fulfilled in one word, in this, “You shall love your neighbor as yourself.”

> in human law there is no place for humility and love. but the prerequisite of fulfilling the divine ordinances is emptying ourselves, humbling ourselves, not claiming anything for ourselves, and sacrificing ourselves to serve others.
