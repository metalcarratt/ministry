details about the manna #1:
- from heaven. contained everything the children of israel physically needed to sustain them for forty years. in the same way christ as the heavenly bread has everything we need.
- with the dew, which is grace. if we don't enjoy grace we don't enjoy the manna
- in the morning. a new beginning every day. if we come to the lord expecting to relive the past and to live the same kind of life we always have we won't receive the manna.

we must come to the lord to have life, not just to the letters of the word. however it is a good habit to contact the lord _in_ the word, because our mind is easily involved in so many affairs of the day.
