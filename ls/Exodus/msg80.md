after establishing the covenant with the blood moses and the seventy elders went up
the mountain to see a vision of God. there they saw God and ate and drank. the bible
says that no one has seen god and that he is invisible, yet it also says the pure in
heart shall sew god. this is not contradictory. under gods feet was a stone like
saphire, crystal clear. this shows in our experience, after we have the blood of the
covenant we deal with everything between us and God to have a clear sky like heaven. then
we will see God and worship Him by eating and drinking in His presence.
