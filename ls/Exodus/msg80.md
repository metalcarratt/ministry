after establishing the covenant with the blood moses and the seventy elders went up
the mountain to see a vision of God. there they saw God and ate and drank. the bible
says that no one has seen god and that he is invisible, yet it also says the pure in
heart shall sew god. this is not contradictory. under gods feet was a stone like
saphire, crystal clear. this shows in our experience, after we have the blood of the
covenant we deal with everything between us and God to have a clear sky like heaven. then
we will see God and worship Him by eating and drinking in His presence.

the people were at the foot of the mountain waiting. experientially they were in the outer court. they eventually fell into idolatry. the 70 elders were on the mountain, worshipping god and eating and drinking. experientially they were jn the holy place. moses was at the top of the mountain being infused with god and receiving the vision of gods dwelling place. experientially he was in the holy of holies. joshua was somewhere inbetween the 70 elders and moses. thus we all ha e different degrees of our closeness to the lord.
