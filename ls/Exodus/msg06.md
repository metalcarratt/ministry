often our attitude is if god wants us to do something we want to do it in our way.
we dont want others to touch us. otherwise we wont do it at all.

> our problem often is that if we cannot do a certain thing by ourselves, then we refuse to do it at all. this attitude has been a great hindrance to the work of the Lord's recovery.

God told Moses multiple times that he wanted him to be a sent one. this means he was not to do something by himself or for himself but to do whatever the sent one asked him to do.
