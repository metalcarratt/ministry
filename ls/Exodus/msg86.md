Christ is the propitiation sacrifice, the one who propitiates between us and God, and the propitiation cover, the place God can meet with His people.

> our goal in reading the bible should be to receive light and not simply to gain objective knoweldge. therefore we need to guard against unnecessary questionings and thoughts which interfere with the shining of the light through the Word. On the one hand we need to ask meaningful questions concerning what we read in the Bible. On the other hand we need to avoid useless questions, questions which have no answers.

the cherubim above the propitiation cover signify the glory of god. also the whole thing being of pure gold signifies the divine nature. we dont know what rhe cherubim were but we know they had faces, eyes and wings. this shows that they were living. this glory that covers the ark, is divine and living. it covers the testimony and is the place where God meets with his people. god only meets with his people in glory. this glory is christ.

Ezk 10:18
> And the glory of Jehovah went forth from over the threshold of the house and stood over the cherubim.

He 9:5
> And above it cherubim of glory overshadowing the expiation cover, concerning which it is not now the time to speak in detail.
