the first offering for the sanctification
of the priests was the sin offering,
showing that we must always be conscious
of our sin. the next offering was the burnt
offering. the burnt offering was for
God's satisfaction. it was first cut into
pieces and then burned. thw priest was
identified with the cut up offering by
the laying on of hands. this shows
that to be a priest we need to be cut
into pieces, washed, amd burned on
the altar.
