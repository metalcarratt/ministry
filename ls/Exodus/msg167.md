the anointing is god coming to us in christ and the incense is christ going go god from us. 
this is a divine two way traffic.

three spices:
- stacte - a kind of edible myrrh, can heal the throat and reduce excess saliva
- onycha
- galbanum - has a disagreeable and even poisonous odor

> The incense was not for God to see; it was for Him to smell. This indicates that God smells our prayer rather than sees it. What does your prayer smell like?
