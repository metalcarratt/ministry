the urim amd the thummim

the thummim is a stone for the extra 
letters of the hebrew alphabet, and the
urim was the light that illuminated the
stones. the breastplate was a memorial
before the urim and thummim were added
but afterward became the breastplate of
judgment because with this God could speak
to his people. he spoke by the stones
becoming dark.

the elders need to read the saints to know
how to care for the church in their locality.

in rom 8:14 being led depends on all the experience of all the forgoing points of 1-13. similarily, to have the speaking we need the stone built into the breastplate with the urim and thummim, all connected via the ephod.

for the stone to shine it had to be transformed, transparent, and inscribed with a specific letter (like 2 cor 3)

with the urim and thummim added the breastplate becomes the breastplate of judgment. the word judgment here is related to the law. it means God has regulations amd his regulation results in a judgment, a ruling, which is paet of his law. it is also his leading.

> God's regulations always include His judgment. For this reason, if we would receive the Lord's leading, many things about us need to be judged by God. Our flesh, our wrongdoings, and our natural life must all be judged by Him. God's regulations require that all theae things must be aet aside. What remains afterward is truly of God. In this way we come to know the Lord's leading.
