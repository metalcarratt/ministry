the urim amd the thummim

the thummim is a stone for the extra 
letters of the hebrew alphabet, and the
urim was the light that illuminated the
stones. the breastplate was a memorial
before the urim and thummim were added
but afterward became the breastplate of
judgment because with this God could speak
to his people. he spoke by the stones
becoming dark.

the elders need to read the saints to know
how to care for the church in their locality.

in rom 8:14 being led depends on all the experience of all the forgoing points of 1-13. similarily, to have the speaking we need the stone built into the breastplate with the urim and thummim, all connected via the ephod.

for the stone to shine it had to be transformed, transparent, and inscribed with a specific letter (like 2 cor 3)
