the urim amd the thummim

the thummim is a stone for the extra 
letters of the hebrew alphabet, and the
urim was the light that illuminated the
stones. the breastplate was a memorial
before the urim and thummim were added
but afterward became the breastplate of
judgment because with this God could speak
to his people. he spoke by the stones
becoming dark.

the elders need to read the saints to know
how to care for the church in their locality.
