moses' stay with God resulted in his face shining from the infusion. he might have been happy to bring
the commandments to the people, but what the people saw was the shining.

the infusion was not through moses speaking to God but God speaking to moses. furthermore it was not His speaking about the commandments that infused him but His speaking about the feasts, the rest, and the qualifications to enjoy the feasting and resting. we need to stop all our talking, leave behind all our preoccupations, including our family, and let God infuse us by speaking to us in His Word about the enjoyment of Himself.

> If we read all of chapter thirty-four, we shall see that God's infusing into Moses was by His speaking. If God had done nothing more than speak the Ten Commandments and the ordinances, I do not believe that Moses would have received much infusion. Do you know whst kind of speaking infuses you? It is the Lord's speaking about the enjoyment of Him, His speaking about feasting and resting and the conditions for enjoying Him. This kind of speaking infuses us with God and causes us to shine.
