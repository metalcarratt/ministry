according to john 1 god is the word, the word
is incarnated to be the tabernacle and this one
is Jesus. the lord is the real tabernacle. this means
he is enterable. however without the offerings
we could not enter the tabernacle. as such Christ
is also the offerings. he is the lamb of god and
he is our way. not only this, as the offerings
he is our food. thus through christ we have the
way to enter into christ and have christ enter us.
it is as such that we can experience the incense
altar. it is when we are in christ as the tabernacle
through the offerings, and when he is in us as our
food and as the one praying in us, that we can
serve at the incense altar
