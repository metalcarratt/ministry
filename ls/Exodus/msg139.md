the goal of exodus 28 and 29 is in vv 29:42-46,
which is to meet with us, speak with us, and
dwell with us.

Ex 29:42
> It shall be a continual burnt offering throughout your generations at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting before Jehovah, where **I will meet with you** **to speak to you** there.

Ex 29:45
> And **I will dwell in the midst** of the children of Israel, and I will be their God.

> god first says that he will meet with us, then that he will speak with us, and eventually that he will dwell in our midst. this indicates that gods dwelling among us depends on his speaking to us and our speaking to him. in other words, it depends on the conversation between us and god. our speaking may keep him away, or it may encourage him to dwell with us.

all the steps of sanctification are the preparation of the priests to feast with god and speak with him. this is like a host preparing a meal for an honoured guest. the proper preparation must be made to welcome the guest. then over dinner there will be the opportunity to hear spoken from the guest.
