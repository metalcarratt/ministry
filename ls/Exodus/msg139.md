the goal of exodus 28 and 29 is in vv 29:42-46,
which is to meet with us, speak with us, and
dwell with us.

Ex 29:42
> It shall be a continual burnt offering throughout your generations at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting before Jehovah, where **I will meet with you** **to speak to you** there.

Ex 29:45
> And **I will dwell in the midst** of the children of Israel, and I will be their God.
