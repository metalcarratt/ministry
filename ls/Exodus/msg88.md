the writings of john also emphasise our need to enjoy christ as the ark in the
tabernacle: life, blood, fellowship and glory.

Jn 1:29
> The next day he saw Jesus coming to him and said, Behold, **the Lamb of God**, who takes away the sin of the world!

Jn 17:1
> These things Jesus spoke, and lifting up His eyes to heaven, He said, Father, the hour has come; **glorify Your Son** that the Son may glorify You;

1J 1:2
> (And **the life was manifested**, and we have seen and testify and report to you the eternal life, which was with the Father and was manifested to us); That which we have seen and heard we report also to you that you also may have fellowship with us, and indeed **our fellowship is with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ**.
