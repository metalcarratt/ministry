we are onyx stones worn by christ on
his shoulders, fastened there by the
ephod. onyx is a precious stone, and
signifies transformation. it is a fact
we are fastened to the shoulders of Christ
and are being transfored. furthermore as we
are being transformed we become an extra
beauty to the christ who is wearing us
before God.

the material of the ephod was gold threads and fine linen threads of blue, purple and scarlet. these four threads were interwoven to form the fabric. furthermore some of the threads were twined to make cords. the ephod was made up of both interwoven linen and gold, and twined cords of linen and gold. this provided the strength to hold the onyx stones in place and bind them to the high priest.
