we are onyx stones worn by christ on
his shoulders, fastened there by the
ephod. onyx is a precious stone, and
signifies transformation. it is a fact
we are fastened to the shoulders of Christ
and are being transfored. furthermore as we
are being transformed we become an extra
beauty to the christ who is wearing us
before God.
