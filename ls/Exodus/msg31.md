after escaping egypt god led his people southward instead of toward canaan. after
crossing the red sea he took them to marah and then elim, both going southward again. we may think the way of resurrection is an upward way but we appreciate the need for resurrection much more in a down situation. thus god leads us downward in the realm of resurrection. this is _his_ way to get the land of Canaan.

twelve springs flowing (downward) and seventy palm trees growing (upward). the springs were prepared from gods creation, and the place trees were prepared from gods planting.

marah is the experience of the cross and elim is the experience of resurrection. ones like madam guyon and brother Lawrence experienced marah, but we need to go on to elim. at marah there is a single tree with sweet water, but at elim there are seventy palm trees with flowing water. this is to water gods plantation.

- River flowing, palm trees growing (life flowing and growing)
- 12=4Ã—3(god mingled with man)=completeness in eternity
- 7=6+1(creator added to man)
- 7=4+3(triune god added to creation)=completeness in time
- 10=fulness (two hands)

Two other case of 70+12, exo 24, 70 elders and 12 tribes. Luke 9+10, 12 apostles and 70 others. Both are related to the carrying out of the ministry. Only life flowing and growing can fulfill the ministry.

Here we see a picture of resurrection: life flowing in a complete and perfect way, and life growing (flourishing, rejoicing in satisfaction, victorious over tribulation) to carry out gods ministry in both time and eternity.

After this gods people encamped as an army. In chapter 17 they fought the battle to get to mount Sinai. At the red sea god fought for them against Egypt, but after experiencing resurrection, marah and elim, they god didn't need to fight for them because they themselves could fight through the flowing and growing.
