after escaping egypt god led his people southward instead of toward canaan. after
crossing the red sea he took them to marah and then elim, both going southward again. we may think the way of resurrection is an upward way but we appreciate the need for resurrection much more in a down situation. thus god leads us downward in the realm of resurrection. this is _his_ way to get the land of Canaan.
