after escaping egypt god led his people southward instead of toward canaan. after
crossing the red sea he took them to marah and then elim, both going southward again. we may think the way of resurrection is an upward way but we appreciate the need for resurrection much more in a down situation. thus god leads us downward in the realm of resurrection. this is _his_ way to get the land of Canaan.

twelve springs flowing (downward) and seventy palm trees growing (upward). the springs were prepared from gods creation, and the place trees were prepared from gods planting.

marah is the experience of the cross and elim is the experience of resurrection. ones like madam guyon and brother Lawrence experienced marah, but we need to go on to elim. at marah there is a single tree with sweet water, but at elim there are seventy palm trees with flowing water. this is to water gods plantation.
