according to 1 cor 10:2, the children of israel were baptised unto Moses when they passed through the red sea. before that they did not follow moses absolutely but after that they feared jehovah and his servant. Moses is a type of christ as our leader. thus when we are baptised we are baptised unto christ. this verse also says they were baptised in the cloud and in the sea. the cloud signifies the spirit and the sea signifies the death of christ.

baptism requires faith. the children of israel had no faith when pharaohs army was behind them and the red sea was before them, but when god spoke the word to Moses to put his staff our over the sea they had faith. when god speaks we have faith.

both Noah and the children of israel were "saved through water". the water saved them from the world and brought them to a place with no bondage or slavery where gods dwelling place could be built.

the song of moses shows that baptism brings God's people to defeat the tribes in Canaan, to the holy mountain of God, to his habitation (the tabernacle and temple) and to the kingdom of God. this shows that gods purpose can only be accomplished when he has a people who have been redeemed, passed through the red sea, and brought to a place without any bondage.

> gods goal in bringing the children of israel through the red sea was to have a dwelling place. before the tabernacle was erected, god did not have a dwelling place on earth. he could have such a dwelling place only after he had secured a people who had been redeemed, who had passed through the red sea, and who had entered into a separated realm where they were free from all bondage.

> mosesknew that gods goal was not merely to save his people out of tyranny, he knew that it was tk have a people set free from the world and brought into a realm of freedom for the building of his dwelling place. because moses knew gods heart, gods will, and gods goal, he could truly be called a man of god.
