chrisitan debate on the correct way to meet, but we need to see that the lighting 
of the lamps in the holy place imply the proper way to meet.

the lightning of the lamps includes all the matter of the lampstand, including the Triune God and His process, His humanity as the wick and the Spirit as the oil. it also includes the proper expression of Christ as the priestly garments, including the breastplate. this is the proper environment and person for the lighting of the lamps.

lighting the lamps takes place in the holy place. the reason we need the light is we are not yet in the holy of holies where the glory of God enlightens. however, by lighting the lamp in the holy place we see clearly the way to enter into the holy of holies.
