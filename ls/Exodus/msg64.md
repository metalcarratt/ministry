when man ate the tree of knowledge he became independent from God, because knowledge makes one independent. commandments can also be in the realm of knowledge.
once man ate of knowledge he knew he had displeased God, thus he desired to do something
for God. fallen man is independent of God and wanting to do something for God.

the law has three functions: to testify of God, to expose us, and to subdue us. the rich man came to the lord and asked what he must do to have eternal life and the lord said to sell his possessions and give to the poor. he was exposed but not subdued, because he went away sorrowing. he should have told the Lord that he could not do it.

> his intention is to use the law to portray himself and then expose us and subdue us so that we may open to him and allow him to come into us to be our life and everything to us. then he will live in us, and we shall live him.
