when man ate the tree of knowledge he became independent from God, because knowledge makes one independent. commandments can also be in the realm of knowledge.
once man ate of knowledge he knew he had displeased God, thus he desired to do something
for God. fallen man is independent of God and wanting to do something for God.

the law has three functions: to testify of God, to expose us, and to subdue us. the rich man came to the lord and asked what he must do to have eternal life and the lord said to sell his possessions and give to the poor. he was exposed but not subdued, because he went away sorrowing. he should have told the Lord that he could not do it.
