gods calling of moses

- God waited until moses' natural strength was used up
> sometimes we are exhausted by gods patience and ask, "how long, lord? have you heard our prayers? lord, where are you? don't you care for us? how long will it be before you do something for us?" it seems that there is no God in the universe. in the psalms such questions are asked again and again, for the psalmist were the same as we are.

> it is good for us to be exhausted by the patience of god because after we are exhausted we rest. we may be so exhausted that we give up praying. we know that God is true and real and that he has his timing. therefore we need to learn to leave the matter with him. then we shall be at rest.

the calling one:
- the angel of jehovah, who is christ, the Son of God. in sending moses God came as an angel, the one himself who was sent by god
- the god of the fathers showing moses had a spiritual lineage
- I am, the verb to be. only he is the self existing and ever existing one.
