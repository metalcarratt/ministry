gods calling of moses

- God waited until moses' natural strength was used up
> sometimes we are exhausted by gods patience and ask, "how long, lord? have you heard our prayers? lord, where are you? don't you care for us? how long will it be before you do something for us?" it seems that there is no God in the universe. in the psalms such questions are asked again and again, for the psalmist were the same as we are.

> it is good for us to be exhausted by the patience of god because after we are exhausted we rest. we may be so exhausted that we give up praying. we know that God is true and real and that he has his timing. therefore we need to learn to leave the matter with him. then we shall be at rest.
