> all the various functions of the word are the actions of a living person. for example, the word comforts us, strengthens us, and upholds us. these are actions of god himself as he upholds, comforts, strengthens, and fills us. all the functions of the law as gods living word as revealed in psalm 119 are the acts and activities of a living person. but if we fail to contact the lord as we read the word, the word will not function this way in our experience. actually, it is not the word that has these functions; it is God Himself who operates in certain ways. we contact this living one through the word and are infused with him and saturated with him so that he becomes our life and our very being. in our experience he functions to give us life and light and to uphold us, strengthen us, and comfort us.

> without using the word you may find it difficult to compose a prayer or praise. but it is easy to pray and praise when we use the bible.
