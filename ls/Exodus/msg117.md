in Genesis there are the materials
gold, bdellium and precious stone. in
the new jerusalem these materials (gold,
pearl, precious stones) are built into a
building. these cases are both before or
after time, so redemption is not an issue.
 ut in 1 cor the materials are gold, silve4
 and ptecious stone. silver is for redemption.
 exodus is consistent with this.

 we should not pursue spirituality or
 power individually but as part of the body.
 the way to deal with opinion and
 peculiarity is also to be in the
 body.
