in Genesis there are the materials
gold, bdellium and precious stone. in
the new jerusalem these materials (gold,
pearl, precious stones) are built into a
building. these cases are both before or
after time, so redemption is not an issue.
 ut in 1 cor the materials are gold, silve4
 and ptecious stone. silver is for redemption.
 exodus is consistent with this.

 we should not pursue spirituality or
 power individually but as part of the body.
 the way to deal with opinion and
 peculiarity is also to be in the
 body.

the clothing of the priests is also a type of building, especially the breastplate. it was possible for a priest to light the lamps or replave the show bread on his own, but to seek tbe lords leading the priest had to use the breastplate, a type of the building.

> Because of our human frailty, our expectation may be that the Lord's recovery would increase and multiply rapidly. However, a large increase in numbers could corrupt and ruin the recovery. Therefore, in His sovereignty, instead of allowing this to happen, the Lord would permit the recovery to be opposed and also purified. The result is that those who do not have a genuine heart for the Lord do not take the way of the recovery. In the past we saw how the Lord came in to purify His recovery. That purification was a test to prove which ones truly have a heart for the Lord's interests.
