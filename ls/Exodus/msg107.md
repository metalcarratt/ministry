the grating was the place that redemption was accomplished, but it was the rings that
supported and provided strength to the grating. this shows that the eternal spirit
is the support and upholding power of christs redemption. this matches heb. 9:14,
which says that christ offered himself through the eternal spirit.

the lords conception was through the holy spirit, and he lived a life under the leading of the spirit. he was a anointed by the spirit and he cast out demons by the power of the spirit. his going to the cross was also according to the spirits leading. heb 9 also says that the priests in the old testament could not offer effective sacrifices because they had to offer them continually, but because the eternal spirit is without beginning or end, the sacrifice christ made is powerful and efficacious.

redemptiom results in the Spirit entering into us as a great treasure. many oppose thw truth concerning the Spirit, meaning they separate the grating fro. the rings.
