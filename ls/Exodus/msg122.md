the onyx stonea were held to the
shoulder straps of the ephod by gold
filaments and chains of gold. these
filaments and chains signify the sufferings
the lord went through in his divinity
when he was on the earth, and also his
beauty. this beauty holds us, as the stones
to the ephod.

the onyx stones were held by the gold
filament but also beautified by it. however
christ is also made more beautiful by the
onyx stones. thus there is a mutual
beautification.
