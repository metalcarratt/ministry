Hoping to be raptured

Still has the flesh, leaning on her beloved as she comes out of the wilderness because she cannot live apart from him.

Concerned for the young believers that they would grow in life.

Working in her vineyard to produce 1000 shelels to pay her beloved and an extra 200 to become her reward.
