By the power of resurrection 
(hind, hart, leaping on the hills)

Brought into the cross (clefts of the
Rock and covert of the precipice)

To be delivered from the self and
Introspection in her down situation.

Rejecting the Lord's call to come out
Until she seeks Him and comes back to
Her mothers house where she was conveived
(Enjoy grace)
