Let Him kiss me
With the kisses of his mouth.
your love is better than wine
Your name is like ointment poured forth
^ loving the lord in an intimate way

Brought into his chambers
^ our human spirit

Black like the tents of kedar
Lovely like the curtains of solomon
^ sinful but redeemed

Led astray by denominational brs

Go forth on the footsteps of the flock
feed your young goats ny the shepherds 
tents
^ coming to the local churches to raise new ones
