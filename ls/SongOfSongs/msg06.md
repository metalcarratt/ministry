Called to live within veil after experiencing ascension.

Still have the flesh, need to experience the cross.

Beloved calls lover but she doesnt want to open
The door as she already washed. He sticks his
Hand in the door and she sees his pierced hand
Then she touched her hand which becomes liquid myrrh.

He hides from her and she goes out to find
him and is wounded by the watchmen who think
their wounding and shaming is helpful to
her. Finally she turns to the younger believers
to ask for help finding him.

They ask her why he is special and she gives
a response, then they are impressed with her
response and ask where he is that they can
seek him together. She realises he is in her spirit
As His garden.
