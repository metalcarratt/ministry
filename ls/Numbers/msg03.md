numbers 2 shows tbe children of Israel arranged in array around the tabernacle.
this glorious encampment is a type of the new jerusalem.

when we look at ourselves and the church we may see many negative things; leaven,
tares, elements of the big tree (caring for numbers and a facade). but God's working
will eventually produce the new jerusalem out of all the current mess.

> In the present church life the elders may have more headaches than joy. However they should not cast the church aside, but should go on until they get out of Matthew 13 and reach the New Jerusalem.
