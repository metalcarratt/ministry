numbers 2 shows tbe children of Israel arranged in array around the tabernacle.
this glorious encampment is a type of the new jerusalem.

when we look at ourselves and the church we may see many negative things; leaven,
tares, elements of the big tree (caring for numbers and a facade). but God's working
will eventually produce the new jerusalem out of all the current mess.

> In the present church life the elders may have more headaches than joy. However they should not cast the church aside, but should go on until they get out of Matthew 13 and reach the New Jerusalem.

details:
- each man had to encamp by his own standard with the ensignia of his father's house. this means that they did not have their own choice or preference about where to be, but had to follow God's ordination and arrangement
- facing the tent of meeting - the testimony of God was their unique goal.
- twelve tribes made up of four camps/sides x three tribes per camp, shows the Triune God (3) mingled with the creature (4)
- it was God's soveriegnty that Jacob had twelve sons, that the one son Levi became the priestly tribe and the two sons of Joseph each became tribes to fill in the gap, and that Levi had three sons who, together with Moses, Aaron and his sons, made another four groups to surround the tabernacle in the center.
