regarding a woman who defiled herself with another man. we should take this
figuratively, remembering that the Lord is our Husband and to be His army
requires us to be chaste to Him.

this mention is a mention of a miracle. it involes holy water (the Spirit), 
a meal offering (The humanity of Christ with death and resurrection), dust and
an earthern bowl (natural created man) and the tabernacle.

the punishment was God's judgment in the form of curses, and included the abnormal
growth of the absoment, resulting in barenness, and the withering of the thighs
(the strength). the woman who was chaste would bear fruit.

thus fruit bearing and strength are related to our faithfulness in love toward
the Lord.
