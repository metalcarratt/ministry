numbers 4 is on the movement of the tabernacle and army. God is an active God. in
the old testament and before God did everything by Himself, but in the NT age God
has joined Himself to man, like in a three legged race. He has restricted Himself
to us by being joined to us. we must match Him, be one with Him and coordinate with Him.

> In the Old Testament, God could move by Himself, without man. For instance,
> when God created the heavens and the earth, there was no need for man to match
> Him. But the New Testament begins with the divine incarnation. This sets up the
> principle for God's New Testament economy, which is that God needs man to match
> Him. Without man, God can do nothing. ... In the New Testament God has given Himself
> to be bound together with man. This binding together of God with man can be
> illustrated by the runners in a three-legged race, who are bound together in such a
> way that each pair of runners has three legs. In the New Testament, God must have
> man to match Him, to be one with Him, to coordinate with Him.
>
> The Lord's move today is with us. Regarding His move, we may be either a "mule wagon" or a "747." By this I mean that if we are slow, the Lord's move with us will be slow. If we are fast, the Lord's move with us will be fast.
>
> Christ, the embodiment of God for His expansion, moves through those who love Him. If we do not move, He cannot move. Rather, He is bound and even imprisoned within us. If we do not move, we become a prison to the Lord.

details:
- the priests had the privilege of "packing" all the things of Christ: thr ark, the lampstand and showbread table. (not clear what packing means)
- all the levitical service was under the supervision of the priests. this means that even when we are doing a non spiritual service such as arranging chairs or serving in the church office, we should do so under the inward, spiritual view of the priesthood. as we arrange chairs we may pray for the person who will sit there, for example.

> While we are caring for business matters, we should minister life to others. If we do tbis, our Levitical service is under the view and supervision of the priesthood.
