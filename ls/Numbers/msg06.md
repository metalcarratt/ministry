dealing with defilement for the formation of the army:

dealing with corporate defilement:
- leprosy, the evil issues from the natural man, especially related to rebellion against authority
- discharges, excessive and unrestrained expression of our self, temper, preferences, likes, dislikes
- touch death, which is more defiling than sin

dealing with personal defilement:
- confessing to the Lord
- repaying the one we tresspassed against, plus 10%
- offering a ram of propitiation to the Lord

these fine dealings are needed for the formation of the army. it is like a small screw in a big machine without which the whole machine cannot operate.

we may say we cannot see such a formation of the army today. however elijiah also prayed this way to thr Lord and thr Lord replied that He had 7000 hidden ones. in the same way today, the Lord has His hidden ones who are being formed as His army, even if we cannot see it openly today.
