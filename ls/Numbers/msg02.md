numbers 1 shows a picture of the whole NT from the incarnation to the new jerusalem.
the incarnation is seen in the ark of the testimony at the center of the encampment
of the children of israel, and the new jerusalem is seen from the encampment itself,
with twelve tribes surrounding the tabernacle, three on each of the four sides, just like
the gates of the new jerusalem.

Christ as the embodiment of God  has been enlarged to a habitation. as the tabernacle
in the center of the encampment he could live among His people. he could also move
with them and fight with them. and their moving and fighting would be directed and
governed by Him as the leader in the middle of their midst.

the children of israel were formed into a body and an army to fight for God, 
serve God, and protect His testimony.

numbered:
- by families - our source of life (from whom we receieved the gospel) is oir spiritual family.
- by the leaders - under the leadership and eldership in the church
- according to age (requiring growth and maturity)
- excluding the women and those under twenty (the weak and immature ones)
