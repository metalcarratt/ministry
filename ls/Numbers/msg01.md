in numbers the redeemd are formed into an army.
exodus stresses the redeemed's worship and living.
numbers stresses the redeemed's journeying and fighting.

three things:
- the formation of the army
- the journeying of the army (not staying in one spot but going on from place to place to gain ground)
- the fighting of the army

the types of Christ:
- as the meaning of our human life. the purpose of the life of the israelites while wandering in the wilderness was only to take care of the tabernacle as the testimony of God
- as the testimony of God
- as the center. the arrangement of the people, with four groups of three tribes on each side and the three families of levi and the family of aaron surrounding the tabernacle, show that Christ is the center of the army
- as the Leader, the Way and the Goal
