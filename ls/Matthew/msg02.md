geneology of matthew starts with abraham. all who are of christ are sons of Abraham,
heirs of the promises (galatians). only by being sons of Abraham can be have a part
of this book.

## abraham

Abraham was called out of babel into the good land, and our history is the same.

Abraham lived by faith, meaning he trusted in god. he had to reject himself, set himself
aside to trust in God. God had to remove Abraham's father, Lot, and Eliezer because they were all people he relied on apart from God. God wanted him to have no one to rely on apart from Himself. this is the meaning of "no longer I but Christ." this is believing in Christ, and this believing is righteousness. don't try to do anything. simply believe in Christ. the fallen race always wants to do something. don't try, don't do, don't work anymore. these are the real sons of Abraham.

Abraham was also required to give back Isaac. even past spiritual experiences of the Lord should not replace the daily walk in faith. do not hold on to anything, even the things given by God.

> If we would be associated with Christ we must repudiate ourselves and take Christ as es everything. This is believing in Christ, and this believing is righteousness in the eyes of God. Do not try to do anything. Simply believe in Christ.
>
> The fallen race always likes to do something, to work and exert some effort. But God says, "Come out of that. You are the called race. Don't try, don't do, and don't work anymore! Forget your past. Forget what you are, what you can do, and what you have. Forget everything, and put your full trust in Me. I am your good land. Live in Me, and live by Me." These are the real Abrahams, the real Galatians. As the sons of God, they trust in God and forget about themselves. ... Today our walk and our living must be by faith in Christ. If so, then, as heirs of God's promise, as those who inherit the promise of the Spirit, we shall participate in Christ as God's blessing.

## isaac

represents the promise

> Sarah, wanting to help God fulfill His promise, made a proposal to Abraham. ... This is the natural concept, and it is quite tempting. Many times our natural concept has some proposal to get us out of the spirit. Often our natural concept says, "Here is a good source. Do it this way!" But such a proposal will surely keep us from God's promise.

Abraham took Sarah's proposal and the result was Ishmael, who frustrated God's promise. Don't produce Ishmaels!

> Terminate yourself! Did you not cross over that great river, the Euphrates? When you were called out of Babel you crossed that great river and you were buried there. You were terminated there. Do not live by yourself or do anything by yourself. Instead, you should say, "Lord, I am nothing. Without You, I can do nothing. Lord, if You don't do anything, then I won't do anything. If You rest. I rest. Lord, I put my trust in You." This is easy to say, but difficult to practice in our daily life.
