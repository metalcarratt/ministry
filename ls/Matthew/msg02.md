geneology of matthew starts with abraham. all who are of christ are sons of Abraham,
heirs of the promises (galatians). only by being sons of Abraham can be have a part
of this book.

Abraham was called out of babel into the good land, and our history is the same.

Abraham lived by faith, meaning he trusted in god. he had to reject himself, set himself
aside to trust in God.
