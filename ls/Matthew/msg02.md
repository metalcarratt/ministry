## abraham

Abraham was called out of babel into the good land, and our history is the same.

Abraham lived by faith, meaning he trusted in god. he had to reject himself, set himself
aside to trust in God. God had to remove Abraham's father, Lot, and Eliezer because they were all people he relied on apart from God. God wanted him to have no one to rely on apart from Himself. this is the meaning of "no longer I but Christ." this is believing in Christ, and this believing is righteousness. don't try to do anything. simply believe in Christ. the fallen race always wants to do something. don't try, don't do, don't work anymore. these are the real sons of Abraham.

Abraham was also required to give back Isaac. even past spiritual experiences of the Lord should not replace the daily walk in faith. do not hold on to anything, even the things given by God.

> If we would be associated with Christ we must repudiate ourselves and take Christ as es everything. This is believing in Christ, and this believing is righteousness in the eyes of God. Do not try to do anything. Simply believe in Christ.

> The fallen race always likes to do something, to work and exert some effort. But God says, "Come out of that. You are the called race. Don't try, don't do, and don't work anymore! Forget your past. Forget what you are, what you can do, and what you have. Forget everything, and put your full trust in Me. I am your good land. Live in Me, and live by Me." These are the real Abrahams, the real Galatians. As the sons of God, they trust in God and forget about themselves. ... Today our walk and our living must be by faith in Christ. If so, then, as heirs of God's promise, as those who inherit the promise of the Spirit, we shall participate in Christ as God's blessing.
