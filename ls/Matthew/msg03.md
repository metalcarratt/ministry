the antecendants of christ are all
people who are associated with christ.
if we want to be associated with christ
we need to learn how they were associated 

tamar - incest with father in law. although
what she did was deplorable it was also
righteous because her heart was on gaining
the birth right. this shows we need to do
whatever it takes to gain the birth right.

pharez and zarah - zarag was supposed
to be born first and get the birthright
but instead pharez was born. this show
that receiving the birthright is a matter
of gods will. tamar is "whosoever wills"
and pharez is "chosen before the foundation
of the world."

rahab - a harlot of jericoh, she was
joined to the leaders of gods people
and produced boaz. we need to join
ourselves to the right people.

boaz - he redeemed ruth at a cost so
that she could regain the birthright.
this is someone who is not selfish with
their enjoyment of christ, but rather is
willing to join themselves with another
who has lost their enjoyment of christ
amd pay the price to help that one enjoy
christ again.

ruth - a moabites, also a source of incest
and barred from gods people. although
barred she did whatever possible to join
herself and regain the birthright

jesse - christ is a shoot of jesse and
also the root of jesse. jesse typifies
someone who is rooted in christ and as
a result is branching forth christ.

david - eigth son, in resurrection. committed one sin.

solomon - result if transgression, repentance, and gods forgiveness. he was the one who built the temple. gods forgiveness needs our transgression. once we transgress, repent, and are forgiven we can be useful to god for his building.
