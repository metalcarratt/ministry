a true priest brings man to God and a true king brings God to man. samuel was a priest
andhe recommended David as the king. John the Baptist was a priest and he recommended
Jesus as the king.

John forsook the way of religion and culture and came in a wild way, in a widlerness.

the book of matthew is on the kingdom. we need to repent for the kingdom. we need to repent
for not being under christ as our king. regardless whether we are a sinner or not, if
we are not under the king we are not in the kingdom and are in rebellion.

we are not in the kingdom because we do not have the king. if we repent the king will come to us and we will have the kingdom.

to preach the gospel we first need to go to the Lord as a priesr to gain Christ as a king. then we need to go to others, speak to them to repent, and bring the king to them.
