a true priest brings man to God and a true king brings God to man. samuel was a priest
andhe recommended David as the king. John the Baptist was a priest and he recommended
Jesus as the king.

John forsook the way of religion and culture and came in a wild way, in a widlerness.

the book of matthew is on the kingdom. we need to repent for the kingdom. we need to repent
for not being under christ as our king. regardless whether we are a sinner or not, if
we are not under the king we are not in the kingdom and are in rebellion.
