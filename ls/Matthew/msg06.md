names of jesus has three elements:
- Jehovah, I am that I am
- saviour, saving us
- salvation itself

this name is for us to:
- believe in
- be baptised into
- to be saved
- to be healed
- washed, sanctified and justified
- to call upon. to get someone saved we dont need to lead them so much to offer long prayers but rather to call upon the lords name louder and louder
- to pray into, be gathered into
- to cast out demons. when casting out demons need to designate the name of Jesus: the Jesus who is God become a man, who died and rose. etc.
- to preach

satan hates the name of Jesus. we get a strange feeling when we try to speak to others about this name.


Jesus is the name given by God, but Emmanuel is the name given by those who have a certain smount of experience of Him. it is one thing for Jesus to be Jehovah, our Saviour and our Salvation. but when we a tually experience Him, then we can say that truly God is with us.
