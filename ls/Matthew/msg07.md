to have the lords leading we need the living star, which is the spirit and the churches.

the way to find the Lord is through the living star, which is the heavenly vision. the way tk get this heavenly vision is to come to Christ in His Word, to take heed to His living Word until something begins to shine over you.

the lord was born in Bethlehem but grew up in Nazareth, which caused a stumbling to
the religious people. he came in a sneaky way. like the tabernacle which was covered
in rough skins but filled with precious materials inside, the Lord did not come with
a comely outward appearance but was filled with the inward riches. the same is true
today of the real seeking saints.
