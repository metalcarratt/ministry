to have the lords leading we need the living star, which is the spirit and the churches.

the lord was born in Bethlehem but grew up in Nazareth, which caused a stumbling to
the religious people. he came in a sneaky way. like the tabernacle which was covered
in rough skins but filled with precious materials inside, the Lord did not come with
a comely outward appearance but was filled with the inward riches. the same is true
today of the real seeking saints.
