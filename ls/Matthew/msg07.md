to have the lords leading we need the living star, which is the spirit and the churches.

the way to find the Lord is through the living star, which is the heavenly vision. the way tk get this heavenly vision is to come to Christ in His Word, to take heed to His living Word until something begins to shine over you.

the lord was convceived in Nazareth, born in Bethlehem, fled to Egypt and grew up in Nazareth, which caused a stumbling to
the religious people. he came in a sneaky way, so that others would not know that He was from Bethlehem. to find Him required looking past the outward appearances and seeing the treasure inside.

like the tabernacle which was covered
in rough skins but filled with precious materials inside, the Lord did not come with
a comely outward appearance but was filled with the inward riches. the same is true
today of the real seeking saints.
