important:
- repent
- kingdom
- heavens

three baptisms:
- by water, John
- by the spirit, by Jesus
- in fire, by Jesus, to burn up all negative things.

The Lord's ministry deals with the mind and heart. John's ministry prepared the people by straightening the flattening the paths. our being is full of upset and downs but John's ministry of repentance causes our heart to be flat and straight so that we can receive the Lord.
