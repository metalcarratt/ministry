the lord was tested.

married life becomes a test. we wonder if we or the lord made a mistake but actually no one made a mistake.
the husband or wife we have is the right one for us.
some conclude if they could choose again they would not make the same mistake but in the end you would still feel that you made a mistake.

same for eldership.

first test was about human living (eating bread). first test is in lowering our standard of living.
while the lord was fasting outwardly he was feasting inwardly. lower our body's physical demand and take care of the spiritual demand.
