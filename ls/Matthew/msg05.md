requirements to bring forth christ:
- gods arrangement
- mary's surrender
- the holy spirits power
- josephs cooperation
it wasnt easy for mary to accept the
angels word for it required her to bare
the shame of hmbeing pregnant before she
got married. it was the same for joseph.
however they were obedient. the holy spirits
power was also required for there was no
way for god to be born in mary without the
power of the spirit

god became flesh. he did not become fallen
but was in the likeness of the flesh of.sin.

jesus is jehovah or saviour  he is our salvation.
joshua is the hebrew equivalent, and he is
the one who brought the children of israel
into rest. thus when we call on the name
of jesus we get salvation and rest.

jesus is also emmanuel, god with us.

finally jesus is the king. when we call on him
he rules in us.
