to offer Christ as the sin offering or tresspass offering does not require us
to have experienced Christ. we only need to cry out and repent and we will be
forgiven imm3lediately. however with the burnt offering we can only offer what we
have experienced of Christ as the burnt offering. it is absolutely not what we can
do but what we experience of Christ who is the only one pure enough to be the burnt
offering.
