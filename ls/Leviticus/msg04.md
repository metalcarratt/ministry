leviticus does not teach us about christ as the burnt offering in his fullness,
but about *how* we offer christ to God as our burnt offering. christ is universally
large but our experience of Him is limited, and grows as we experience and grow more
in Him. for this reason there are the dove, the lamb and the bull.
