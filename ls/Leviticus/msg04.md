leviticus does not teach us about christ as the burnt offering in his fullness,
but about *how* we offer christ to God as our burnt offering. christ is universally
large but our experience of Him is limited, and grows as we experience and grow more
in Him. for this reason there are the dove, the lamb and the bull.

#### slaughtered

the burnt offering was slaughtered. this was Christs living on earth. for example before pilate. if we experience christ while being "slaughtered" in our married life and church life, we will be able to offer a burnt offering to God.

> sometimes we reason with the brothers or with or spouse. whenever we do this, we turn away from the cross. reasoning in nothing but a turning away from being slaughtered. if this is our situation, then at the lords table there will be no praises to the Lord. whatever we say in our prayer or praise will mean nothing because we have not had the real experience of christ in His sufferings, and hence, no burnt offering.


> certain ones may oppose or criticize us, but we shall not fight with them. without saying anything, we shall simply allow others to lead us to the cross and slaughter us. if this is our experience, we shall have a large burnt offering to bring to God, and we shall have much praise in the tent of meeting.

#### skinned

to be skinned is to be defamed, stripped, of the beauty of human virtues. for example some called the Lord Jesus a samaritan. demon possessed and insane. paul was accused by the corinthians of being crafty for monetary gain. in 2 cor. 6:3-13, paul lists the qualifications of being a minister of God, and one of them is "glory and dishonor", "evil report and good report", showing that in Paul's mind the spreading of evil reports about him were an evidence of him being a minister of God.

although we can experience the skinning our experience is relative. only christ has the absolute experience of being the burnt offering.

#### cut into piece

to be accused of doing something wrong is to be cut into pieces. problems can only be solved with forgiveness. to forgive is to forget. labouring on christ includes being willing to be cut into pieces. 

> do you know what it means to forgive? to forgive is to forget. if you touch some saints in the church life wrongly, they may not forgive you their entire lifetime. this unwillingness to forgive affects the praises at the Lord's table.

#### washed

the inwards parts and legz were washed with water. the lord was not dirty because he was continually washed inwardly by the holy spirit. we need to be the same.

#### a satisfying fragrance

the burnt offering was burned slowly for Godz satisfaction. only the life of complete obedience can be pleasing to god. for this we need to lay our hands on christ as our burnt offering.
