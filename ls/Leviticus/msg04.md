leviticus does not teach us about christ as the burnt offering in his fullness,
but about *how* we offer christ to God as our burnt offering. christ is universally
large but our experience of Him is limited, and grows as we experience and grow more
in Him. for this reason there are the dove, the lamb and the bull.

the burnt offering was slaughtered. this was Christs living on earth. for example before pilate. if we experience christ while being "slaughtered" in our married life and church life, we will be able to offer a burnt offering to God.

> sometimes we reason with the brothers or with or spouse. whenever we do this, we turn away from the cross. reasoning in nothing but a turning away from being slaughtered. if this is our situation, then at the lords table there will be no praises to the Lord. whatever we say in our prayer or praise will mean nothing because we have not had the real experience of christ in His sufferings, and hence, no burnt offering.


> certain ones may oppose or criticize us, but we shall not fight with them. without saying anything, we shall simply allow others to lead us to the cross and slaughter us. if this is our experience, we shall have a large burnt offering to bring to God, and we shall have much praise in the tent of meeting.
