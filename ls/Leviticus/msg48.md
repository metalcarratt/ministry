taking care of the sacrifices and the blood.

to take care of the sacrifices is to take care of the Person of Christ, who is oir
unique sacrifice in many ways (burnt, meal, sin, tresspass, peace). to take care
of the blood is to take care of the redemptive work of Christ.

regarding the sacrifices, the children of Israel were charged to only sacrifice them
at the entrance of the tent of meeting. otherwise they would be prostituting
themselves by offering to "goat demons". to offer at the entrance of the tent of
meeting is to offer in the proper church life, on the proper ground, that does not
take any other name than Christ, and respects the proper marriage relationship with
our Husband, Christ.
