taking care of the sacrifices and the blood.

to take care of the sacrifices is to take care of the Person of Christ, who is our
unique sacrifice in many ways (burnt, meal, sin, tresspass, peace). to take care
of the blood is to take care of the redemptive work of Christ.

regarding the sacrifices, the children of Israel were charged to only sacrifice them
at the entrance of the tent of meeting. otherwise they would be prostituting
themselves by offering to "goat demons". to offer at the entrance of the tent of
meeting is to offer in the proper church life, on the proper ground, that does not
take any other name than Christ, and respects the proper marriage relationship with
our Husband, Christ.

specifically the burnt offering bad to be offered at the tent of meeting. my interpretation of this is tbat our consecration is only good for the church life. we should not consecrate ourselves to anything else.

to take care of the blood is to drink, take in, believe in, only the blood of Christ. the blood of those who died by themselves signifies heroes who have sacrificed themselves for others, and the blood of those torn by beasts signifies those who have been martyred by wild people. these kinds of people cannot save us. almost every religion is based on such a person. but we have only Christ with His redemptive work.

those who had drunk other blood had to bathe in water and wash their clothes until evening, signifying a complete dealing with other religious beliefs.
