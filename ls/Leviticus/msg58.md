caring for the other saints in the church life:
- not mis treating a brother who is poor, but helping him in the spirit
- if someone is indebted to us and we try to help him we should not consider ourselves superior
- at the time of grace the ones we are caring for will be healed. in a sense it is not up to us and what we do, but God's timing
- helping a brother who is indebted to an outsider

the main thing that redeems us is the grace of God. man tries many things to be
released from sin and spiritual deadness, but what we need is grace. in His
sovereignty God may arrange our circumstances so that we can do nothing but rely
on the grace of God.
