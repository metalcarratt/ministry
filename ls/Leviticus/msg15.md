The Lord was God from eternity past who became a man. His humanity was mingled with
divinity from His birth. Apart from the Holy Spirit He had no way to be born:

Lk 1:35
> And the angel answered and said to her, The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you; therefore also the holy thing which is born will be called the Son of God.

The Lord was anointed with the Spirit economically for power. however the form the
Spirit came in was as a dove, a figure of gentleness, showing that the Spirit here
is a Person, not just a power.

Lk 1:35
> And the angel answered and said to her, The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you; therefore also the holy thing which is born will be called the Son of God.
