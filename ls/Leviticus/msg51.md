enjoying the holy things in holiness - we must be careful how we enjoy Christ.

- anyone who is unclean may not eat the holy things unless he first bathes himself. this means we must not enjoy Christ while being in an unclean state. we need to wash away all the defilement that we may eat.
- an outsider or a slave cannot eat, but a slave purchased by a priest and belonging to his household can eat. this means the unbelievers cannot enjoy Christ, but if we are redeemed then we can
- a daughter of a priest who marries someone outside cannot eat, but is she is widowed or divorced and returns to her father's house she can eat. this means that our relationship with certain unbelievers can cause us to lose our enjoyment of Christ, but if we cut off the relationship cleanly we can be returned to the enjoyment of Christ.
- someone who eats in ignorance restoring what he ate to the priest plus one fifth. this means it is possible for us to be self deceieved concerning our enjoyment of Christ. any kind of false enjoyment needs to be dealt with before God.

### the vow and freewill offering

both are a kind of consecration, but a freewill offering is weaker and may be voided but a vow is stronger.

all of a vow, a freewill offering and a peace offering can become a burnt offering. this is because a burnt offering is related to being absolute for God. sometimes we sense our lack of absoluteness and so make up our mind to be different, making a vow before the Lord which becomes a burnt offering. other times we more casually realise our lack of absoluteness and make a choice to be absolute. at still other times, when we are at the Lords table, enjoying the Lord as our peace offering, the Lord touches us and we spontaneously give ourselves to Him. this is a peace offering becoming a burnt offering.
