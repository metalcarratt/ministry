enjoying the holy things in holiness - we must be careful how we enjoy Christ.

- anyone who is unclean may not eat the holy things unless he first bathes himself. this means we must not enjoy Christ while being in an unclean state. we need to wash away all the defilement that we may eat.
- an outsider or a slave cannot eat, but a slave purchased by a priest and belonging to his household can eat. this means the unbelievers cannot enjoy Christ, but if we are redeemed then we can
- a daughter of a priest who marries someone outside cannot eat, but is she is widowed or divorced and returns to her father's house she can eat. this means that our relationship with certain unbelievers can cause us to lose our enjoyment of Christ, but if we cut off the relationship cleanly we can be returned to the enjoyment of Christ.
- someone who eats in ignorance restoring what he ate to the priest plus one fifth. this means it is possible for us to be self deceieved concerning our enjoyment of Christ. any kind of false enjoyment needs to be dealt with before God.
