the sabbath year and the jubilee

## the sabbath year

the sabbath year is a year of complete rest. God is a God of rest. during that year
the produce of the land was common, for everyone to enjoy. also God's blessing came
to cause the land to produce threefold so that there would be enough to eat during
the sabbath year.

## the jubilee

we all sold ourselves to sin and Satan, and as a result lost our divine rights. the more we commit sin the more we lost our rights. this is why we need the jubilee, to restore us to our rightful possession.

> in type, the jubilee portrays our situation as poor sinners. our situation is that the longer we lived, the more we lost our dively allotted portion. because we lived in a sinful way, we lost the divine rights. the more we committed sin the more these rights were lost. eventually, we sold all that we had inberited by birth. we even lost ourselves. we sold ourselves, not to a proper buyer, but to Satan and sin. this was the reason Paul could say, "I am fleshly, sold under sin" (Rom 7:14b).

the jubilee was not a pentecostal day but a pentecostal year. just as pentecost was the eighth eighth day, and comprised eight (?) sabbath days, so the jubilee is the eighth eighth sabbath year and comprised eight sabbath years, to be a full and complete rest, and resurrection on resurrection.
