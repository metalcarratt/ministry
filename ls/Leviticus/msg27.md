# the law of the peace offering

- the weakest - the peace offering for a thanksgiving offering
  - fine flour mingled with oil, the Spirit
  - offered with leavened bread, signifying the weak state of the offerer
  - part of it offered as a heave offering (Christ in ascension)
  - that part being the priest's who offered it (when we minister the ascended Christ we also enjoy Him)
  - to be eaten on the day it is offered (the lasting power of the thanksgiving offering is weaker)
- stronger - the peace offering for a vow or freewill offering
  - to be eaten the same day or next day (stronger lasting power)
  - eating on the third day being abhorent (our enjoyment of Christ must be fresh, not old)
  - not eaten if it touches anything unclean (our enjoyment must be kept from uncleanness)
  - the person eating it should also be clean
  - if an unclean person eats of it they are cut off from their people (partaking of the Lord's table while in sin, as in 1 cor)
  - not eating the fat (the top portion always belongs to God)
  - if it touched anything that died naturally not to be eaten (stay away from death - this also makes a distinction between Christ's death, which is holy and an offering to God, distinct from natural or satanic death, which is abhorent to God)
  - the blood not eaten (regard only the blood of Christ)
  - the person who eats blood to be cut off from the people (not making the blood of Christ a common thing)
