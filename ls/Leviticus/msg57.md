three ways to recover what was sold:
- the "nearest relative" (Christ) redeeming it for us (a matter of grace)
- buying it back ourselves (what the Jews aim to do, a matter of law?)
- receiving it back in the Jubilee (also a matter of grace)

a house in a walled city being sold could only be redeemed in a year. after that it cannot
be redeemed. the house in a walled city is our enjoyment of the church life. if we
lose our enjoyment of Christ we can easily gain it back, but if we lose the enjoyment
of the church life it is not so easy. if we do not recover it before the millenium we will
lose it for the millenium. 

> we need to consider losing the church life more serious than losing the enjoyment of Christ.
