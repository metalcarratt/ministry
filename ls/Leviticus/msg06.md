offering the burnt offering is related to our experience of christ in our daily
life. if we do not experience christ in our daily life, when we come to the meeting
we will not have much of a burnt offering to present, but mostly a tresspass offering.

the daily experience of christ is experiencing his being slaughtered, skinned and
cut into pieces.

Pp 3:10
> To know Him and the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death,

the daily experience of the burnt offering also includes taking christ as our wisdom, signified by the head of the bull, and of being washed by the spirit inwardly and outwardly by thr spirit, signified by the washing with water. the washing of the holy spirit keeps us outwardly from defiling things and washing away anything defiling that gets into us.

the fire signifies the Holy God. with the burnt offering, this fire was for acceptance, and can be likened to God's mouth. with the sin offering and tresspass offering, this fire was for judgment. the fire for burnt offering (but not the fire for sin or tresspass) was to never go out; the priests had to add wood to it to keep it burning continually.
