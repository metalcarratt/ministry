the books of Hebrews unveils to us the wonderful Person of Christ as our high priest.
in every chapter of leviticus we can find Christ, because He is the reality of all
the offerings.

the offerings are for:
- propitiation of sins (what most people understand)
- to appease God and make Him happy with us
- food for God
- food for us, the priests

Jn 6:57
> As the living Father has sent Me and I live because of the Father, so he who eats Me, he also shall live because of Me.

as the offerings, Christ is our food. as the offerings He is many different "courses",
such as the burnt offering, meal offering, sin offering, tresspass offering, peace
offering, wave offering, heave offering, free will offering and drink offering.
Apart from Christ we have nothing to offer to
God. the Christ we have eaten and experienced should be the Christ we offer to God
for His satisfaction.
