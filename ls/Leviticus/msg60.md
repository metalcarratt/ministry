> Seeing the vision of the processed Triune God with His work and the result of His work will constitute us into obedient ones. We will say, "Amen, Lord, I love You. I love Your work, and the result of Your work. In this result I am one with You, and You are one with me. You are working Yourself into me, and I am being constituted with You. Lord, obeying You is not hard or harsh but sweet and enjoyable. I like to enjoy all that You are, to enjoy Your work, and to enjoy the result of Your work. Lord, here I am in the enjoyment of Yourself, of Your work and of the church life!" Surely if we have such a vision and have such an enjoyment, we shall be fully satisfied, and it will be easy for us to give up the world and obey God.
