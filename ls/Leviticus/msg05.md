the differences in the burnt offering were not only in their size but also in the
way they were offered. the bull, ram and goat were slaughtered, cut into pieces
and washed. this was all done by the offerer. however the doves or pigeons had their
necks wrung, feathers taken off and wings torn. this was done not by the offerer but
by the priest. this shows that the young ones appreciate christ in a natural way, in
an unprocesswd way. they bring their appreciation to the meeting but are not able to
process it and so others are needed to process and complete their offering.

those who are more experienced have detailed experiences of christ. for example:
- the head, Christ as their understanding, wisdom, and prudence
- the inwards, Christs in His sensibility, thoughts, affections, feelings, intentions, will
- the inward parts washed with water - the Spirit constantly keeping Him clean and pure throughout all His contact with earthly people
