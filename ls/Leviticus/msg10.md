to live Christ as the burnt offering is not to imitate Him but to live Him.

there are many verses that can be used to indicate we should follow Christ. such as:

Mt 11:29
> Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me, for I am meek and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls.

1Co 11:1
> Be imitators of me, as I also am of Christ.

however Paul's thought is that we would live Christ:

Ga 2:20
> I am crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live in faith, the faith of the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself up for me.

Pp 1:21
> For to me, to live is Christ and to die is gain.
