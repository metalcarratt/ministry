the law of the meal offering

offered before Jehovah in front of the altar - offered before God and related to l
redemption on the cross.

in the outer court - we enjoy Christ in the sphere of the church

christ is our meal offering so that we can serve God as priests. this means if we are
not serving as priests we have no right to enjoy the meal offering.

> according to my study of the new testament, the first thing we should do as God's priests is to preach the gospel and bring the sinners to God as offerings. this is what Paul did; his preaching of the gospel was a priestly service. in his priestly service he offered gentiles to God. do we have some saved sinners whom we can offer to God?
> 
> the book of leviticus is altogether concerned with the priests. nearly every chapter concerns the life, living, need and supply of the priests and all the other things related to them. if we are not priests in actuality, we are not qualified to enter into this book. therefore, i am deeply burdened to beg you to come back to your heavenly calling as priests of God. the first duty of our priestly service must be to bring sinners to present to God as offerings.

> in these days while i am considering the book of leviticus, my heart is weeping. the more i read and study this book, the more my heart is weeping. among us there is little that would cause us to be joyful. we are talking about the priestly food, but who are the priests, and where are they? in this message i am burdned to stress this one point--the book of leviticus is for the priests.
>
> regarding the priestly service, we need to consider our situation and ask ourselvea where we are. the prophet haggai charged the people of israel to consider their ways. we all need to reconsider our way. what kind of believers are we? are we priestly believers or common believers?

> We need to remember that the first three offerings--the burnt offering, the meal offering and the peace offering--bring us into the light. In the light we are enlightened to see our sin and our sins. This is what we need.
