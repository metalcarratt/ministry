the law of the meal offering

offered before Jehovah in front of the altar - offered before God and related to l
redemption on the cross.

in the outer court - we enjoy Christ in the sphere of the church

christ is our meal offering so that we can serve God as priests. this means if we are
not serving as priests we have no right to enjoy the meal offering.

> according to my study of the new testament, the first thing we should do as God's priests is to preach the gospel and bring the sinners to God as offerings. this is what Paul did; his preaching of the gospel was a priestly service. in his priestly service he offered gentiles to God. do we have some saved sinners whom we can offer to God?
> 
> the book of leviticus is altogether concerned with the priests. nearly every chapter concerns the life, living, need and supply of the priests and all the other things related to them. if we are not priests in actuality, we are not qualified to enter into this book. therefore, i am deeply burdened to beg you to come back to your heavenly calling as priests of God. the first duty of our priestly service must be to bring sinners to present to God as offerings.
