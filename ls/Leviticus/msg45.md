discharges from the body. showing that everything that comes out of our
natural being is unclean and contagious.

- whether it runs or stops it is unclean (everything good or bad)
- whoever it touches is unclean (contagious)
- unclean until evening (the need of a new start in resurrection
- washing the clothes and bathing (the need of the Spirits washing and the Word which embodies the Spirit).
- rinsing the hands with water
- breaking the earthenware vessel (our created but fallen vessel), but rinsing in water the wooden vessel (our God-created humanity)
- seven days (to the extent our natural life is dealt with)
- two turtledoves for a sin offering and burnt offering (deal with sinful nature to live a life for God)
- separated to not die by defiling the tabernacle (our natural discharge is actually worse than leprosy, for it can defile God's building (the church) and bring in spiritual death.


> The matter of our discharges should cause us to be discredited in our own eyes. However, everyone gives himself high credit. We may regard only ourselves as right and everyone else as wrong. We may think that we are excellent and hold on to our prestige. Nevertheless, there is something about us that is not worthy of credit, and this thing is our natural discharge. Seemingly we have no problems, but we are still defiled by the unclean discharges of our natural life.
