pentecost

pentecost happened on the eighth eighth day. it was the fiftieth day from the day of firstfruits
(day of resurrection), the day after the sabbath. so the first of the fifty days was
and eighth day. then seven weeks (49 days) were counted, and it was the eighth day after that.

this shows pentecost, the forming of the church is in resurrection of resurrection.

two loaves were presented as a meal offering. these two loaves were fine flour plus
leaven. Christ as our meal offering is the sinless one, so He does not have leaven.
however these two meal offering loaves typify the church, one loaf for the jews and
another loaf for the gentiles. as the church, there still is the element of sin, since
we are not yet fully transformed. for this reason these two loaves were baked with leaven.
