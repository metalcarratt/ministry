> I must tell you that hardships await you and that there is not future for you on earth. You wilo have nothing earthly on which to rely for your security and for your human living. You may feel that you will be very useful to God, but in the end you will be ashes. Everybody wants to be somebody, but if you would serve the Lord Jesus full-time, you must prepare yourself to be nobody, even to be ashes. Are you willing to be burned? To be burned to ashes is a matter not of suffering but of enjoyment. ... eventually the outcome of such a life ... will be a heap of ashes.
