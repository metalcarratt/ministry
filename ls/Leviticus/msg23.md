## the law of the burnt offering

> I must tell you that hardships await you and that there is not future for you on earth. You wilo have nothing earthly on which to rely for your security and for your human living. You may feel that you will be very useful to God, but in the end you will be ashes. Everybody wants to be somebody, but if you would serve the Lord Jesus full-time, you must prepare yourself to be nobody, even to be ashes. Are you willing to be burned? To be burned to ashes is a matter not of suffering but of enjoyment. ... eventually the outcome of such a life ... will be a heap of ashes.

> Christ is my security, even though He sometimes hides Himself from me in order to test me. As a result of my experience and learning, I can tell you that the best time to enjoy the Lord Jesus is when He is hiding from you. After seeming to disappear for a while, He will spontaneously appear to us again. This is often His way with us. Such a Christ is our real security.

- the fire kept burning continually and not going out - signifies God always willing to accept what we offer to Him as a burnt offering.
- burning wood every morning - our cooperation to burn the burnt offering
- wearing linen garments and changing clothes to take the ashes outside the camp - the stately way we must treat the result of the burnt offering. to the world it is just ashes but to God they are precious and full of worth.
