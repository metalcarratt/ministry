christ as the burnt offering.

in hebrews christ came to do the will of God. this will was to replace the old covenant sacrifice and offerings with himself as the new covenant sacrifice and offerings. to be qualified to be the replacement for the old covenant sacrifices and offerings the lord had to be absolute for God in all things. if there were even one thing in which he were not absolute for God, then He would need another to be His Savior and He would be disqualified. thus it is as the burnt offering that he was able to do the will of God to replace the old covnenant sacrifices and offerings.

the burnt offering could be different sizes because our appreciation and ability to offer are different. pauls experience of christ was a large bull because his experience of Christ was far greater than ours.

all the animals that qualified to be a burnt offering had a will to move and act. any such life can become blemished. but because the lords will was fully subdued by God he never became blemished.
