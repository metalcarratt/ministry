christ as the burnt offering.

in hebrews christ came to do the will of God. this will was to replace the old covenant sacrifice and offerings with himself as the new covenant sacrifice and offerings. to be qualified to be the replacement for the old covenant sacrifices and offerings the lord had to be absolute for God in all things. if there were even one thing in which he were not absolute for God, then He would need another to be His Savior and He would be disqualified. thus it is as the burnt offering that he was able to do the will of God to replace the old covnenant sacrifices and offerings.

the burnt offering could be different sizes because our appreciation and ability to offer are different. pauls experience of christ was a large bull because his experience of Christ was far greater than ours.

all the animals that qualified to be a burnt offering had a will to move and act. any such life can become blemished. but because the lords will was fully subdued by God he never became blemished.

the offer had to lay their hands on the offering. in the bible laying hands on something is a matter of identification. by being identified with Christ He bears all our weaknesses and we are one with Him as the absolute one to live for God.

the burnt offering was for expiation. by laying our hands on Christ the problem between us and God is gone.

the burnt offering was slaughtered, skinned and cut into pieces. this is Christ dying for us. skinning was him being stripped of the outward expression of his virtues. cut into pieces was him letting his whole being be broken without any reservation. 

the proper prayer is not for us to ask God to do something for us outwardly, but to lay our hands on Christ, being identified with Him. then he will live the burnt offering life in us.

> we need to lay our hands on the lord in order to have a subjective prayer. in such a prayer we may say, "lord, I lay my hands on you, causing myself to be identified with you and you to be identified with me." when we lay our hands on christ through subjective prayer, the life-giving Spirit, who is the very Christ on whom we lay our hands, will immeidately move and work within us to live a life that is qualified for the burnt offering.
