Acts 10 (Peter's vision of the great sheet descending) is an exposition of
Leviticus 11 (Discernment in eating).

the Bible needs expounding, especially
Leviticus. the apostles like Paul and Peter expounded it, the brethren expounded
further and brother Lee has expounded even further. we are standing on all their
shoulders.

> to eat is to contact things outside of us that could affect us inside. this especially refers to our contacting of people. when we eat we contact something that is outside of us, something that has nothing to do with us. however, if we eat that thing, it can affect us inside. in Leviticus 11 the things we eat signify people, and eating signifies our contacting of people.


> to eat is not merely to contact something but also to receive something into us. once a thing is received into us, that thing can be digested inside to become our constituent, that is, our being, our constitution. we all are a constitution of the food we eat and digest. eventually, what we digest becomes us; it becomes our very constitution. this indicates that contacting people is an important matter. if we intend to live a holy life as required by the holy God, we need to be careful about our contact with people. our contact with certain kinds of people can cause us to be reconstituted and thus make us another kind of person. whatever we contact we will receive, and whatever we receive will reconstitute us, making us a different kind of person from what we are now.

## the kinds of animals (people) who are clean and thus healthy for us to eat (contact)

### those with divided hooves and who chew the cud
divided hooves are those who discern between earthly and heavenly things, things of God and things of Satan, spiritual vs fleshly, of the new man vs the old man.

to chew the cud is to take the word of God with much consideration and reconsideration. one way of doing this is while pray reading the word in the morning.

### fish with fins and scales
these fish live in the sea (the world) but they have fins with which to move freely (not together with the current of the world) and scales to prevent them from being salted by the world.
