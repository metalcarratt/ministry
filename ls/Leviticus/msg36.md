Acts 10 (Peter's vision of the great sheet descending) is an exposition of
Leviticus 11 (Discernment in eating).

the Bible needs expounding, especially
Leviticus. the apostles like Paul and Peter expounded it, the brethren expounded
further and brother Lee has expounded even further. we are standing on all their
shoulders.

> to eat is to contact things outside of us that could affect us inside. this especially refers to our contacting of people. when we eat we contact something that is outside of us, something that has nothing to do with us. however, if we eat that thing, it can affect us inside. in Leviticus 11 the things we eat signify people, and eating signifies our contacting of people.
