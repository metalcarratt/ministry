Acts 10 (Peter's vision of the great sheet descending) is an exposition of
Leviticus 11 (Discernment in eating).

the Bible needs expounding, especially
Leviticus. the apostles like Paul and Peter expounded it, the brethren expounded
further and brother Lee has expounded even further. we are standing on all their
shoulders.
