keeping the lamps burning continually was the high preist's job. this is Christ
taking care of the light within us. every morning we need to come to Him to get light.

the bread is Christ's humanity as our life supply in a full way (12 loaves). the bread is not only our food but God's as well.

new bread was arranged every Sabbath, showing that we need to enjoy Christ to have a proper rest. the bread was eaten in a holy place, showing that Christ needs to be enjoyed by us as our food in the church.

a story about an egyptian woman who married an israelite and cursed the holy name of God. this shows our marriage with the world can cause us to blaspheme the holy name, and doing this prevents us from being able to enjoy Christ as our light and food.

finally a word on caring for man and animals. man is primarily for expressing God, and animals are primarily for offering to God in worship. the meaning is thus that we need to care for both a proper expression of God and a proper offering as a worship to God.
