keeping the lamps burning continually was the high preist's job. this is Christ
taking care of the light within us. every morning we need to come to Him to get light.

the bread is Christ's humanity as our life supply in a full way (12 loaves). the bread is not only our food but God's as well.

new bread was arranged every Sabbath, showing that we need to enjoy Christ to have a proper rest. the bread was eaten in a holy place, showing that Christ needs to be enjoyed by us as our food in the church.
