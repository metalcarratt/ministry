the main item of the burnt offering is blood because we need propitiation, not
just for what we have done but for what we are. the main items of the meal offering
are the oil and the frankincense. both are God's food. God eats with fire, and the
laying out of the burnt offering in an orderly way shows that God eats in a very orderly
way. the burnt offering was only for God, but with the meal offering there is also
a portion for us.

the way to eat the meal offering is through the Spirit (the oil). when we pray read over the word His human living becomes ours.

> over a period of fifteen hundred years, god has prepared a book for us, the Bible, and has put it in our hands. He has also given His Spirit to us. The Spirit is within and the book is without. These two things added together are just Christ in His human life. When we exercise our spirit and pray-read the Word, we touch the Spirit and enjoy Christ's human living. This is the meal offering.

#### mingled

Ps 92:10
> But You have exalted my horn like that of a wild ox; / I am anointed with fresh oil.

'anointed' here means 'mingled'. Christs living on earth was one of fine flour mingled with oil; of humanity mingled with divinity. paul also testified "it is no longer I but Christ" and "Christ lives in me." this is the mingling.
