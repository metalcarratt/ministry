the main item of the burnt offering is blood because we need propitiation, not
just for what we have done but for what we are. the main items of the meal offering
are the oil and the frankincense. both are God's food. God eats with fire, and the
laying out of the burnt offering in an orderly way shows that God eats in a very orderly
way. the burnt offering was only for God, but with the meal offering there is also
a portion for us.
