a house with leprosy - a church which is sick with sins and evil

- the owner telling the priest - the leading ones
- empty the house - isolate and limit the contagion
- priest examining the house - the Lord visiting in grace
- disease in the walls, beneath the surface - the problems are deep, beneath the surface
- shut up for seven days - a complete period of time to observe the situation
- if spread the infected stones taken to an unclean place outside the city - the believers involved in the disease removed from the fellowship
- taking other stonea and putting them in their place - new believers to fill the gap
- plastering with new mortar - new experiences of grace
- if still spreading whole house taken down
- when shut up whoever goes in unclean till evening
- he who lies down or eats and drinks washing their clothes - those who are idle and only receiving (not positively engaged in service) needing to be washed in their conduct and behaviour.

the way of cleansing

- experiencing again the experiences the Lord passed through
- blood of the bird and living water - the blood of Christ and the Spirit
- the bird let free over an open field - experience of ascension
