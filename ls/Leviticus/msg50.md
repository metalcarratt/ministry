the holy living of the priests

- not to defile themselves for a dead person : this is to be careful not to touch anything
- that would profane us, that is, make us like common worldly people.

- not to make our hair bald. cut the sides of our beard, or make a cutting in our flesh : this is to
-  change what we are naturally by birth, to not accept God's sovereignty in His creation of us.
-
-  my interpretation: certainly God wants to transform us, to change our nature. but this is
-  not something we can or should do ourselves. we must allow God to work on us.
