the holy living of the priests

not to defile themselves for a dead person : this is to be careful not to touch anything
that would profane us, that is, make us like common worldly people.

not to make our hair bald. cut the sides of our beard, or make a cutting in our flesh : this is to change what we are naturally by birth, to not accept God's sovereignty in His creation of us.

 my interpretation: certainly God wants to transform us, to change our nature. but this is not something we can or should do ourselves. we must allow God to work on us.

not disheaveling the head or tearing the garments : not to be loose in submitting to God's authority, not to be unrestained in our daily walk, not to be bankrupt in our morality.

the high priest not defiling himself even for the death of father or mother : the ordinary priests could care for their parents death but not the high priest. this means the higher we go in our priesthood the more we need to be wary of natural affection of even the closest ones defiling us in any way.

the defetcs that disqualify us from serving as priests:
- blindness : lack of sight because of a lack of Christ as light
- lameness : lack of strength to act and serve
- flat nose : lack of spiritual discernment
- one limb longer than the other : overstepping outside of Christ, not remaining in our limit
- broken foot or hand : some part of our spiritual life that is not complete, perfect and balanced.
- being hunchback : seeing the things on the world but not the things in heaven, where our ascended Christ is.
- being a dwarf : lacking in the stature of Christ
- defective sight : not having a full view of Christ
- eczema and scabs : an abnormal expression in life that make us feel unpeaceful and others unpleasant
- damaged testicles : the spiritual reproductive function damaged by a lack of experience in life.
