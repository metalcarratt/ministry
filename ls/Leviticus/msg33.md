nadab and abihu

offered strange fire. this strange fire is something natural; natural enthusiasm,
natural affection, natural strength, natural ability. we may love God but our love
is natural. we may be burning for the Lord but our burning is natural. the natural
lifr must be condemned and put on the cross.

the result of offering strange fire was death. moses recognised the end of man's life
was 80 years. but it is when he was 80 that God came in to call him. this means that
his natural life had run out and he was now in resurrection.
