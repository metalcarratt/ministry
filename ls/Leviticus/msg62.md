a vow to Jeohvah

leviticus starts with the offerings and the priesthood and then gives us a 
negative vision of what we are in our self. after that we are brought to the feasts
and finally to the jubilee. leviticus ends with a warning and finally the proper
response we should have: a vow.

as a vow we can offer to the Lord a person, animal, house or land.

this message is a bit hard to understand, but what I can understand is: 
- our value before God differs, based on male vs female (ability to go to war), spiritual age, deterioration, etc.
- also that once we devote ourselves it is a serious thing, and if we try to go back on our devotion we may have to pay a price.
- nevertheless, our life is a vow, within us there is a desire to make a vow, and every morning when we come to have morning revival there is a desire to give ourselves to the Lord. this is what the Lord wants.
