## the cleansing of the leper

#### brought to the priest

we need to come to the Lord

#### the priest going outside the camp to examine the leper

The Lord came to us outside the camp.

> And when He came down from the mountain, great crowds followed Him.
> 
> And behold, a leper, coming near, worshipped Him, saying, Lord, if You are willing, You can cleanse me.
>
> And stretching out His hand, He touched him, saying, I am willing; be cleansed! And immediately his leprosy was cleansed.

Matt. 8:1-3

#### the leper needing to seek cleansing before God.

On God's side He heals us, but on our side we need to seek His cleansing. This is our cooperation.

#### the process of cleansing

- birds - a transcending life
- live birds - full of life
- clean birds - Christ who has no defilement
- two birds, one that died and one that lived - Christ in His death and resurrection
- cedar wood - the Lord's uplifted humanity
- hyssop - the Lord's humanity that was willing to be made so low
- scarlet - the shedding of blood (also kingly)
- one bird killed over an earthenware vessel (humanity) filled with living water (the Spirit) - Heb 9:13-14, Christ offering up Himself in the flesh through the eternal Spirit.
- the other bird, cedar, hyssop, scarlet (probably tied together and) dipped in blood and sprinking the leper 7 times - the subjective experience of the Lord's sufferings in shedding His blood in His noble but also lowly humanity and His death, resurrection, ascension and glorification.
- the live bird going free - soaring in ascension
- the leper shaving all his hair, the hair of his head (glory), beard (honor), eyebrows (beauty) and all his hair on his body (strength)
- bathing in water - whole being buried in the death waters
- remaining outside seven days - dealing with sin in a serious way, not light, loose or careless
- on the seventh day shaving and washing again - dealing with sin thoroughly
