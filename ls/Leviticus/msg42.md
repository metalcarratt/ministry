the cleansing of the leper

- brought to the priest

we need to come to the Lord

- the priest going outside the camp to examine the leper

The Lord came to us outside the camp.

> And when He came down from the mountain, great crowds followed Him.
> 
> And behold, a leper, coming near, worshipped Him, saying, Lord, if You are willing, You can cleanse me.
>
> And stretching out His hand, He touched him, saying, I am willing; be cleansed! And immediately his leprosy was cleansed.

Matt. 8:1-3

- the leper needing to seek cleansing before God.

On God's side He heals us, but on our side we need to seek His cleansing. This is our cooperation.
