# the sin offering

sin dwells in us, causing us to do "that which I do not will" (rom 7:17). Christ came
as the brass serpent, in the likeness of the flesh, to terminage the flesh of sin.

the death of Christ as the sin offering deals with: sin in the flesh, the old man,
satan, the world. as such the sin offering is less about forgiveness of sins and more about
the power to be freed from all the enslaving elements. as the sin offering Christ
terminates everything sinful, fallen, natural in us, including Satan, that we may be
freed to absolute for God, live a life of the meal offering, and have peace with God.

> we need to have this realisation whenever we take Christ as our sin offering. the sin offering means that sin in the flesh has been condemned, that our old man has been crucified, that Satan has been destroyed, and that the world has been condemned and the ruler of the world cast out.
