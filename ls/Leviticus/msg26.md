since we are regenerated we have another life with another law. this law has a
sense. we need to learn how to live according to this law with its sense. we
need to aspire to live such a way. the type in the old testament shows that even
in our enjoyment of Christ there is a law to restrict us; if we are loose or sloppy
we wont enjoy Christ as much.

> I would like to help you make a decision, to make up your mind, to live and walk according to the law of the new life. you need to decide not live any longer according to the old way. you are not what you were before you were saved. you are a new creation, a regenerated person, a member of the new man.
>
> immediately after their regeneration, some believers have not only the desire and the aspiration, but even the ambition to be new, holy, heavenly persons. but perhaps some of you have not yet made such a decision. i am concerned that you will continue to live, act and behave in the old way. therefore, i would urge you, even beg you, to make a decision that you will not be as you were in the past.
