since we are regenerated we have another life with another law. this law has a
sense. we need to learn how to live according to this law with its sense. we
need to aspire to live such a way. the type in the old testament shows that even
in our enjoyment of Christ there is a law to restrict us; if we are loose or sloppy
we wont enjoy Christ as much.

> I would like to help you make a decision, to make up your mind, to live and walk according to the law of the new life. you need to decide not live any longer according to the old way. you are not what you were before you were saved. you are a new creation, a regenerated person, a member of the new man.
>
> immediately after their regeneration, some believers have not only the desire and the aspiration, but even the ambition to be new, holy, heavenly persons. but perhaps some of you have not yet made such a decision. i am concerned that you will continue to live, act and behave in the old way. therefore, i would urge you, even beg you, to make a decision that you will not be as you were in the past.

## the law of the tresspass offering

basically: if we minister Christ to others, we will also enjoy Him in that aspect.

- being holy (dont take it in a light way)
- offered in the place the burnt offering is slaughtered (the tresspass offering is based on Christ as our burnt offering. only because he is absolute for God can He be our substitute for sin)
- every male eating it in a holy place (when we minister the tresspass offering to others we are the strong ones, and we must do so in a place apart from sin)
- sin offering and tresspass offering law being one
- the priest who offers it has it (when we minister to others it also becomes ours)
- the priest who offers the burnt offering keeps the hide (when we minister the burnt offering to others Christ becomes our enveloping protection)
- every meal offering offered in a pot or pan being the priests (if we minister the suffering Christ we also enjoy Him)
- every meal offering mingled with oil or dry being the priests (as above?)
