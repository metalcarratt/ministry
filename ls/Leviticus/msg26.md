since we are regenerated we have another life with another law. this law has a
sense. we need to learn how to live according to this law with its sense. we
need to aspire to live such a way. the type in the old testament shows that even
in our enjoyment of Christ there is a law to restrict us; if we are loose or sloppy
we wont enjoy Christ as much.
