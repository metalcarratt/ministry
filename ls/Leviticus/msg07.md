Christ's experiences as the burnt offering

## being brought to the slaughter

Showing His obedience in being slaughtered.

Mt 27:31
> And when they had mocked Him, they stripped Him of the robe and put His garments on Him, and led Him away to crucify Him.

Pp 2:8

## being slaughtered

Ac 2:23
> This man, delivered up by the determined counsel and foreknowledge of God, you, through the hand of lawless men, nailed to a cross and killed;
