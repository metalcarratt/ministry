Christ's experiences as the burnt offering

## being brought to the slaughter

Showing His obedience in being slaughtered.

Is 53:7
> He was oppressed, and it was He who was afflicted, / Yet He did not open His mouth; / Like a lamb that is led to the slaughter / And like a sheep that is dumb before its shearers, / So He did not open His mouth.

Mt 27:31
> And when they had mocked Him, they stripped Him of the robe and put His garments on Him, and led Him away to crucify Him.

Pp 2:8
> And being found in fashion as a man, He humbled Himself, becoming obedient even unto death, and that the death of a cross.

## being slaughtered

Ac 2:23
> This man, delivered up by the determined counsel and foreknowledge of God, you, through the hand of lawless men, nailed to a cross and killed;

even the way the Jews killed the passover lamb, by tying its legs to a cross section of wood, may be a type of the Lords being slaughtered on the cross.

## skinned, stripped

Mt 11:19
> The Son of Man came eating and drinking; and they say, Behold, a gluttonous man and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners. Yet wisdom is justified by her works.

Mk 3:22
> And the scribes who came down from Jerusalem said, He has Beelzebul, and by the ruler of the demons He casts out the demons.

Jn 8:48
> The Jews answered and said to Him, Have we not spoken well in saying that You are a Samaritan and have a demon?

Mt 26:65
> Then the high priest tore his garments, saying, He has blasphemed! What further need do we have of witnesses? Behold, now you have heard the blasphemy.

Mt 27:28
> And they stripped Him and put a scarlet robe around Him,

Ps 22:18
> They divide my garments to themselves, / And for my clothing they cast lots.

## cut into pieces

the first three hours on the cross

Mk 15:29-32
> And those who were passing by blasphemed Him, wagging their heads and saying, Aha! You who destroy the temple and build it in three days,
> 
> Save Yourself and come down from the cross!
> 
> Likewise also the chief priests with the scribes mocked Him with one another and said, He saved others; Himself He cannot save.
> 
> Let the Christ, the King of Israel, come down now from the cross that we may see and believe. Those who were crucified with Him also reproached Him.

Ps 22:16-17
> For dogs surround me; / A company of evildoers encloses me; / They pierce my hands and feet.
> 
> I count all my bones; / They look, they stare at me.


## head of wisdom

### growing in wisdom

Lk 2:40
> And the little child grew and became strong, being filled with wisdom, and the grace of God was upon Him.

Lk 2:52
> And Jesus advanced in wisdom and stature and in the grace manifested in Him before God and men.

### speaking maxims

The Lord spoke seemingly contradictory statements:

Mk 9:40
> For he who is not against us is for us.

and

Mt 12:30
> He who is not with Me is against Me, and he who does not gather with Me scatters.

However in Matthew He was speaking concerning those who cast out demons, and thus spoke about tolerating those witg different outward practices. in Mark He was responding to the pharisees who had called Him Lord of the demons, and referred to the need to maintain inward unity.

### in being questioned

knowing they were lying and thus not responding to their question (Matt 21:23-27)

Mt 21:27b
> He too said to them, Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things.

when questioned concerning taxes He first had them produce a roman coin and then used wise words to deflect their question (Matt. 22:15-22)

Mt 22:21b
> Then He said to them, Render then the things that are Caesar’s to Caesar and the things that are God’s to God.

## being a delight to God (fat) through absolute obedience

Mt 3:17
> And behold, a voice out of the heavens, saying, This is My Son, the Beloved, in whom I have found My delight.

Jn 6:38
> For I have come down from heaven not to do My own will but the will of Him who sent Me.

Jn 7:18
> He who speaks from himself seeks his own glory; but He who seeks the glory of Him who sent Him, this One is true, and unrighteousness is not in Him.

## the inward parts

### His mind set on the fathers business

Lk 2:49
> And He said to them, Why is it that you were seeking Me? Did you not know that I must be in the things of My Father?

### His emotion burning for the house of God

Jn 2:17
> His disciples remembered that it was written, “The zeal of Your house shall devour Me.”

### His will subdued by the Father

Mt 26:39b
> yet not as I will, but as You will.

### His soul voluntarily poured out

Is 53:12b
> Because He poured out His life unto death


### His heart - never discouraged

Is 42:4
> He will not faint, nor will He be discouraged,

### knowing in His spirit

Mk 2:8
> And immediately Jesus, knowing fully in His spirit that they were reasoning this way within themselves, said to them, Why are you reasoning about these things in your hearts?

## His walk (legs) being perfect, powerful in word and work

Lk 24:19
> And they said to Him, The things concerning Jesus the Nazarene, who was a Prophet powerful in work and word before God and all the people;

Jn 8:46
> Which of you convicts Me of sin? Since I speak truth, why do you not believe Me?

## washed - kept by the Holy Spirit from all defilement

Lk 4:1
> And Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, returned from the Jordan and was led by the Spirit in the wilderness, while being tempted for forty days by the devil.
