Christ's experiences as the burnt offering

## being brought to the slaughter

Showing His obedience in being slaughtered.

Is 53:7
> He was oppressed, and it was He who was afflicted, / Yet He did not open His mouth; / Like a lamb that is led to the slaughter / And like a sheep that is dumb before its shearers, / So He did not open His mouth.

Mt 27:31
> And when they had mocked Him, they stripped Him of the robe and put His garments on Him, and led Him away to crucify Him.

Pp 2:8
> And being found in fashion as a man, He humbled Himself, becoming obedient even unto death, and that the death of a cross.

## being slaughtered

Ac 2:23
> This man, delivered up by the determined counsel and foreknowledge of God, you, through the hand of lawless men, nailed to a cross and killed;

even the way the Jews killed the passover lamb, by tying its legs to a cross section of wood, may be a type of the Lords being slaughtered on the cross.

## skinned, stripped

Mt 11:19
> The Son of Man came eating and drinking; and they say, Behold, a gluttonous man and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners. Yet wisdom is justified by her works.

Mk 3:22
> And the scribes who came down from Jerusalem said, He has Beelzebul, and by the ruler of the demons He casts out the demons.

Jn 8:48
> The Jews answered and said to Him, Have we not spoken well in saying that You are a Samaritan and have a demon?
