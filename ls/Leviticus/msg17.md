# the peace offering

the peace offering is the issue of the burnt offering (Lev 3:5, 6:12) and the meal offering (7:37).
Christ is the one absolutely for God, and He is also our food. it is only by enjoying
such a Christ, identifying ourselves with Him in His absoluteness every morning, and
feeding on Him as our life supply throughout the day, that we can have peace.
