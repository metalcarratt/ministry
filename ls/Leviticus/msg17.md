# the peace offering

the peace offering is the issue of the burnt offering (Lev 3:5, 6:12) and the meal offering (7:37).
Christ is the one absolutely for God, and He is also our food. it is only by enjoying
such a Christ, identifying ourselves with Him in His absoluteness every morning, and
feeding on Him as our life supply throughout the day, that we can have peace.

the fattened calf slaughtered for the prodigal son is an illustration of the peqce offering bringin peace between the father and son.

the different kinds of peace offerings are because our experience of christ is different, not because Christ Himself is sometimes strong and sometimes weak. the strongest peace offering was the male of the herd. next was the female, which signifies a weaker experience of Christ. After that is a sheep and a goat. the sheep typifies one that is perfect and beautiful. in matthew 25 goats are not good. this signifies that even when we are in a pitiful condition we can still experience Christ as a goat.

the blood was dashed around the altar showing that it is for us to see and have peace.
