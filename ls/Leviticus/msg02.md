Christ is the reality of both the tabernacle and the offerings. the tabernacle is
Christ in incarnation as God coming to man. the offerings are christ in crucifixion
and resurrection bringing man to God.

the offerings are christ for us to enjoy and partake of that He may get into us. the tabernacle is christ for us to contact, touch, and enter into.

by eating christ he becomes our constitution and we are mingled with him. this should cause us to appreciate the revelation of the mingling of divinity and humanity. pauls epsistles tell us christ is edible, but leviticus shows us the "groceries" and even "recipe" for "cooking" Him. 

the tabernacle is for God to dwell in and the offerings are for God to enjoy. however both the tabernacle and the offerings are Christ. does this mean God dwells in Himself and enjoys Himself? this is thr mystery of the trinity. however with regard to the offerings, it is the Christ appreciated and presented by us that God enjoys. if we do not enjoy them and present them God will notnhave any enjoyment of them. the children of israel laboured on the good land, and we endevaour to enjoy and experience Christ that we may have something to offer back to him.

> the tabernacle is for Gods dwelling, and the offerings are for Gods enjoyment. does this mean that God dwells in Himself and enjoys Himself? the answer to such a question involves the mystery of the Trinity. the Lord Jesus says, "I am in the Father, and the Father is in me."  the book of Hebrews reveals that Christ has presented Himself to God for God's satisfaction. Here we see the mystery of God becoming a man to die on the cross and then rising up in resurrection for God and for us.

> the offerings are for God to enjoy through our appreciation and presentation. without our appreciation and presentation of Christ as the offerings, God cannotbhave any enjoyment of the offerings. God has come to us in Christ, becoming the tabernacle, the dwelling place, for Himself. He has also become all the offerings for us and for Himself. If we do not appreciate these offerings and present them to God, God will not have any enjoyment of the offerings.
>
> Just as the Israelites were to labor on the good land to have the produce to offer to God, so we need to labor on Christ that we may be able to present Him to God. to labor on Christ is to endeavor to enjoy Him and to experience Him. the more we enjoy and experience Christ, the more we shall appreciate Him. then we should present Christ to God for His enjoyment.

the root of the word "bring" and "offering" are the same, the word for "present". the offerings we bring are a kind of present or gift we bring to have fellowship with an intimate friend.

the church meetings are cooking meetings. christ is the groceries and we and God are the eaters. but we alone are the cooks. through our experience of Christ as the groceries we cook him and then present him in the church meetings as food for both God and one another.

> have you ever realised that the church meeting is a cooking meeting, and eating meeting? ... The groceries are here, and the eaters are also here, but who are the cooks? I have the assurance to say that God and the Spirit are not the cooks, but that we are the cooks. Therefore, we must all learn to cook.
