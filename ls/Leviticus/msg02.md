Christ is the reality of both the tabernacle and the offerings. the tabernacle is
Christ in incarnation as God coming to man. the offerings are christ in crucifixion
and resurrection bringing man to God.

the offerings are christ for us to enjoy and partake of that He may get into us. the tabernacle is christ for us to contact, touch, and enter into.
