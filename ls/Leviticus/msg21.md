# the tresspass offering

the sin offering deals with our nature of sin, the tresspass offering deals with our
acts of sin.

if the offerer brought two pigeons or fine flour the tresspass offering was composed
of both the sin offering and the burnt offering. this signifies that our outward
sins are a result of our inward nature of sin and our living that is not fully for
God. this is like a fruit tree that needs a certain environment to grow. the fruit
tree is our inward nature of sin and the environment that helps it to grow is our
living not for God. the fruit of these two are the outward sins we commit.
