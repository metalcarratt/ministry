in hebrew the word "propitiation" actually means "to cover", and has the same root
as the word for the cover on the ark. inside the ark were the ten commandments which
condemn us before God. but the lid on the ark cover the commandments so that the holy,
righteous God can meet with us.

in the septuagint this word is translated as propitiation, meaning two appease two
parties.

propitiation is a covering of our sins, but in the new testament we have redemption. redemption is not the covering of sins but the taking of sins away.
