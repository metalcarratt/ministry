in hebrew the word "propitiation" actually means "to cover", and has the same root
as the word for the cover on the ark. inside the ark were the ten commandments which
condemn us before God. but the lid on the ark cover the commandments so that the holy,
righteous God can meet with us.

in the septuagint this word is translated as propitiation, meaning two appease two
parties.

propitiation is a covering of our sins, but in the new testament we have redemption. redemption is not the covering of sins but the taking of sins away.

to come before God, aaron needed:
- a burnt offering and sin offering to come before God to deal with the total problem of his nature.
- to bathe in water
- to wear a linen tunic, linen breeches, a linen sash, and a linen turban, which is Christ as our righteousness and holiness to cover us completely and be our expression.

one goat was killed on the altar for sin, the other goat was sent away to azazel, who is Satan. God does not only forgive and take away our sin but also sends it back to Satan, the source of our sin. in eternity in the lake of fire, Satan will bear the responsibility for all our sins of which he is the source.

aaron brought coals from the altar and burned incense. negatively Christ solved our problem before God, but positively He also becomes the sweet smelling savor for our acceptance by God. before we had the unclean issues, now we have Christ as our sweet savor. this is all based on His death.

the blood sprinkled seven times before and on the propitiatory cover signifies the complete and eternal efficacy of Christ's redemption for us.
