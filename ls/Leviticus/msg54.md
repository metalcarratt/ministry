the last three feasts are types of what will happen in tbe future:
### the feast of blowing of trumpets

when God will call His scattered people (the Jews) back to Him, both physically and spiritually, at His return at the end of this age.

between the feast of pentecost and the feast of blowing of trumpets is the time of tbe church age.

Lev. 23:24
> Speak to the children of Israel, saying, In the seventh month, on the first day of the month, you shall have a complete rest, a memorial commemorated by the blowing of trumpets, a holy convocation.

### feast of propitiation

the day of man's repentance and redemption as a result of the trumpeting of the gospel.

a time of complete rest.

Lev. 23:27
> And on the tenth day of this seventh month is the Day of Expiation; you shall have a holy convocation, and you shall afflict your souls and present an offering by fire to Jehovah.

Lev. 23:29
> If there is any person who does not afflict himself on that same day, he shall be cut off from his people.

afflict your souls in this verse is the proper repentance attitude we should have when we hear the gospel.
for the Jews who are saved by the Lord's second coming, this is fulfilled in:

Zech. 12:10
> And I will pour out on the house of David and on the inhabitants of Jerusalem the Spirit of grace and of supplications; and they will look upon Me, whom they have pierced; and they will wail over Him with wailing as for an only son and cry bitterly over Him with bitter crying as for a firstborn son.
