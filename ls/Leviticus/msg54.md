the last three feasts are types of what will happen in tbe future:
### the feast of blowing of trumpets

when God will call His scattered people (the Jews) back to Him, both physically and spiritually, at His return at the end of this age.

between the feast of pentecost and the feast of blowing of trumpets is the time of tbe church age.

Lev. 23:24
> Speak to the children of Israel, saying, In the seventh month, on the first day of the month, you shall have a complete rest, a memorial commemorated by the blowing of trumpets, a holy convocation.

### feast of propitiation

the day of man's repentance and redemption as a result of the trumpeting of the gospel.

a time of complete rest.

Lev. 23:27
> And on the tenth day of this seventh month is the Day of Expiation; you shall have a holy convocation, and you shall afflict your souls and present an offering by fire to Jehovah.

Lev. 23:29
> If there is any person who does not afflict himself on that same day, he shall be cut off from his people.

afflict your souls in this verse is the proper repentance attitude we should have when we hear the gospel.
for the Jews who are saved by the Lord's second coming, this is fulfilled in:

Zech. 12:10
> And I will pour out on the house of David and on the inhabitants of Jerusalem the Spirit of grace and of supplications; and they will look upon Me, whom they have pierced; and they will wail over Him with wailing as for an only son and cry bitterly over Him with bitter crying as for a firstborn son.

### the feast of tabernacles

the new heaven and new earth in the millenium and as a foretaste of the new jerusalem, the eternal tabernacle of God with man.

for seven days, a full course of time, signifying the 1000 years.

bringing offerings and resting - enjoying Christ as food and enjoying true rest in God.

after the harvest - after God has completed His work on the earth.

taking the fruit of beautiful trees, branches of palm and evergreen trees and rejoicing - the beautiful rich humanity of the Lord expressed through His people

Lev. 23:40
> And on the first day you shall take for yourselves the product of stately trees, branches of palm trees and boughs of leafy trees and willows of the brook; and you shall rejoice before Jehovah your God for seven days.

dwelling in booths - recognition that apart from God and the New Jerusalem as our eternal home, we have no dwelling place on this earth and are but sojourners.

Lev. 23:42
> You shall dwell in booths seven days — all who are native in Israel shall dwell in booths —

Lev. 23:43
> So that your descendants may know that I made the children of Israel to dwell in booths when I brought them out of the land of Egypt; I am Jehovah your God.
