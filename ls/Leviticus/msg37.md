lev 11 is about eating ane contacting people; it is also about abstaining from
death. if we contact clean things we will get life but if we contact unclean things
we will get death. death is an ugly, abominable thing. what we are abstaining from
is actually abstaining from death.

life is pure but death is complicated. knowledge, good and evil are all related to
death. they all consummate in death.

any sin can be forgiven immeidately through the tresspass offering, but touch the carcass of an animal makes us unclean till the end of the day, and touching the carcass of a human makes us unclean seven days. this shows death is more defiling than sin.

further points:
- if we are defiled by death we should "wash our clothes", which is to wash the defilement of death away from our daily living
- this washing is by the cleansing of the Spirit of life, by our praying ourselves into the Spirit
- a vessel upon which a carcass has fallen must be broken, signifying the breaking of our natural life
- if a spring (flowing water) or a seed has a carcass touch it it is not unclean because these are things of life and have the strength to resist the defilement of death. these signify Christ.
