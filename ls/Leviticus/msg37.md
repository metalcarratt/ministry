lev 11 is about eating ane contacting people; it is also about abstaining from
death. if we contact clean things we will get life but if we contact unclean things
we will get death. death is an ugly, abominable thing. what we are abstaining from
is actually abstaining from death.

life is pure but death is complicated. knowledge, good and evil are all related to
death. they all consummate in death.
