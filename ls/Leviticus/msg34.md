right after the judgment of nadab and abihu by fire Moses commanded Aaron and his
remaining sons to eat the meal offering, not offer a sin offering. this shows God's mercy following His
judgment.

if we realise someone has a problem with sin we must first pray for them. then under the Spirits leading you may go to him and fellowship with him in order to bring him into the light. if you can bring him into the light the light will shine on him and he will see his sinfulness and shortcomings.

> do not try to help a sinful one by exposing him or by directly pointing out his shortcomings. if you do this, you will insult him. every sinner holds to his prestige. if you point out a brothers sin, he will not confess it but will hold to.his prestige. furthermore, instead of bringing the brother into the light, you will provoke him and cause problems.
