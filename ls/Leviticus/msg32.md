> the atmosphere of the meetings indicate where we are with God. no one can pretend. the meeting is truly an exhibition of our christian life, in particular of the degree to which we enjoy Christ in our private daily life and in our family life. our meeting is an exhibition of our actual enjoyment of Christ. if we enjoy Christ, the meeting will be an exhibition of the riches of Christ. if we do not enjoy Christ, there will not be an exhibibition of the riches of Christ in the meeting. in this matter shouting and praising do not help, for the meeting is not under our control. the point here is that our experience of Christ affects the meetings; if especially affects, even determines, the atmosphere of the church meetings.
