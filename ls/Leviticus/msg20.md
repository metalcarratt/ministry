#### the power struggle

sin involves five things:
- the flesh
- sin
- Satan
- the world
- the prince of the world

the last item, the prince of the world, involves a power struggle between Satan and
God. because we have sin, we are involved in this power struggle. why are we not
absolute for God? it is because we have some struggle with God, and behind this
struggle is Satan.

> a sister may experience this struggle while shopping in a department store. she may want to but a particular item, but senses that the Lord does not agree. she begs the Lord to give her permission to make the purchase this one time. her begging is actual a sign of a struggle between her and the Lord. Satan is hidden within such a struggle.

the deeper meaning of sin is the law of sin, which is a spontaneous power, strength and energy to struggle with God.

> do you know what the law of sin is? the law of sin is simply the spontaneous power, strength and energy to struggle with God. Something within us is living and active; it is crouching in our inner being, watching over us. Whenever we have eveb a little thought of being for God, something within rises up to take us over. This is the law of sin.


> we should not take Christ as our sin offering in a superficial way. rather, we shuold take Him as our sin offering to a deeper extent. This will remake our entire being.

#### based on the burnt offering

slaughtered at the place of the burnt offering and all burned up outside the camp at the place the ashes of the burnt offering were placed. this means the basis for the sin offering is God's acceptance of the burnt offering. as the burnt offering, Christ was absolute for God. the power struggle within us caused by sin makes us for ourselves and not for good. anything we do, even good things such as loving others, offering a prayer or speaking a testimony can be a sin if we do it for ourselves or out of ourselves. for example, the Lord said that the pharisees make long prayers for a pretense, disfigure their faces to appear to be fasting, and make a trumpet when they give offerings. this is to do "righteous deeds" for ourselves and our of ourselves. this is not absolute for God, is due to the power struggle within us between God and Satan, and is sin.

the more we enjoy christ as the burnt offering the more we realise we are not for God and recognise our sin. thus we need the sin offering. in all our service we need the sin offering, even in doing the most holy things. others may think that we are quite good, that we are wholly for the church, but we ourselves know that we are not, and that we constantly need the sin offering.
