sin involves five things:
- the flesh
- sin
- Satan
- the world
- the prince of the world

the last item, the prince of the world, involves a power struggle between Satan and
God. because we have sin, we are involved in this power struggle. why are we not
absolute for God? it is because we have some struggle with God, and behind this
struggle is Satan.

> a sister may experience this struggle while shopping in a department store. she may want to but a particular item, but senses that the Lord does not agree. she begs the Lord to give her permission to make the purchase this one time. her begging is actual a sign of a struggle between her and the Lord. Satan is hidden within such a struggle.

the deeper meaning of sin is the law of sin, which is a spontaneous power, strength and energy to struggle with God.

> do you know what the law of sin is? the law of sin is simply the spontaneous power, strength and energy to struggle with God. Something within us is living and active; it is crouching in our inner being, watching over us. Whenever we have eveb a little thought of being for God, something within rises up to take us over. This is the law of sin.


> we should not take Christ as our sin offering in a superficial way. rather, we shuold take Him as our sin offering to a deeper extent. This will remake our entire being.
