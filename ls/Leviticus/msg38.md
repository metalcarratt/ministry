uncleanness in human birth.

in ch 11 we are unclean by contacting different kinds of people, but in ch 12 we
see that we are unclean from birth. from head to toe we are a totality of uncleanness.

the uncleanness from our birth is inward and related to our nature, as opposed to the uncleanness from contacting people, which is outward and related to our conduct.

a woman who gave birth to a man was unclean seven days (full course of life) and to a woman fourteen days (double). after the seven days she had to wait 33/66 days. this makes 40 (or 80) days. this is a time of trial or testing. on the eight day the male child was to be circumcised.

by nature we are all full and doubly unclean. the solution is cicrumcision on tbe eigth day. this is the cross in resurrection. furthermore after the completeness of the testing of uncleanness a burnt offering and sin offering were to be offered. this is because we do not live a life for God and we are full of sin.

in this chapter Christ is four things to meet our need: the eight day, circumcision, the burnt offering and the sin offering.
