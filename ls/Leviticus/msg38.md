uncleanness in human birth.

in ch 11 we aee unclean by contacting different kinds of people, but in ch 12 we
see that we are unclean from birth. from head to toe we are a totality of uncleanness.

the uncleanness from our birth is inward and related to our nature, as opposed to the uncleanness from contacting people, which is outward and related to our conduct.
