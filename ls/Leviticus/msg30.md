hearing. as sinners we did not have a heart for God's word and listened to many other
things. now the first and primary thing we need to deal with is our hearing. do not
listen to negative speaking. as servants our ear also needs to be pierced to give
heed to the words of our master.

the priests hands were filled with the bread, the thigh and the breast. first the animal
was slain (redemption) and then these parts were waved (resurrection) and then became
what filled the priests hands for the service to God.

- garments sprinkled with anointing oil and blood (our conduct constantly needs the blood and the anointing of the Spirit)
- the flesh and bread eaten at the entrance of the tent of meeting (the redeeming Christ and His humanity is our food)
- the remains burned with fire (always something left over since Christ is inexhaustable, and this is kept by God's holiness)
- priests remaining there for seven days, that they may not die (the solemnity of the priesthood and our attitude toward eating Christ)
