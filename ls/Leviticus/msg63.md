the valuation of land was according to:
- how much seed was needed to sow the land
- how many years until the jubilee.

the spiritual significance of this is that the valuation of our consecration is
according to:
- what extent our consecration can result in the increase of life in the church and the spreading of the gosepl
- the measure of grace we enjoy

the earlier we give ourselves to the Lord, the more years the Lord has to do something
through us for the increase of life and the spreading of the gospel.
