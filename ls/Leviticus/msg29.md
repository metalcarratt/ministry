after being anointed with the oil (spirit) the priest offered a sin offering and a
burnt offering. the Spirit anoints us with everything He is and has done, but we need
a continual reminder that within us is the flesh of sin, and that we are not absolute
in living for God. both the sin offering and burnt offering were offered daily. we know we need to live Christ but do we? when our self is touched and we get offfended, this is proof that we are living for ourselves and not for the Lord.
