after being anointed with the oil (spirit) the priest offered a sin offering and a
burnt offering. the Spirit anoints us with everything He is and has done, but we need
a continual reminder that within us is the flesh of sin, and that we are not absolute
in living for God. both the sin offering and burnt offering were offered daily. we know we need to live Christ but do we? when our self is touched and we get offfended, this is proof that we are living for ourselves and not for the Lord.

a ram was offered as a consecration offering. some of the blood was put on the tip of Aaron's ear, thumb and toe. this signifies the redeeming blood cleansing our ears, hands and feet. feet are for moving and hands are for working. these are both directed by our hearing. if we hear negative things it will affect how we move and work. 

> by hearing we have been saved, and by hearing we may be nourished and edified. however, by hearing we may also be damaged and killed, and we may do evil things to others because of what we hear. our hearing is a problem. in 2 timothy 4:3 Paul speaks of those who "heap up to themselves teachers tickling the ear." therefore, God's dealing must first touch the source--our hearing.

> since we are God's priests, we need to ask ourselves what kinds of things we are willing to hear. do we intend to hear positive things or negative things? because we often hear unclean things, things that are unhealthy and contagious, we need to wash our ears with the blood of Christ.

aaron's hands were filled with:
- an unleavened cake and an oiled cake (the sinless Christ as the Spirit filled Christ to feed the priest)
- a wafer (Christ with which to feed other younger ones)
- the portions of fat (for God's satisfaction)
- the right thigh (Christ as strength for the priest to enjoy)
and waved as a wave offering (resurrection).

moses waved the right breast as a wave offering, signifying that the one consecrating the priest enjoyed what he ministered to the priest. whenever we serve others, by preaching the gospel to them or feeding them, we also enjoy the same thing of Christ as our porion.
