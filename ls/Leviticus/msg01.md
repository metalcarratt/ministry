Gods revelation in the bible is progressive:
- in genesis god created man but man fell and rebelled against God. God came in to call a called race, but this race also fell into egypt. the end of genesis is a man in a coffin.
- in exodus God saved and redeemed his people in egypt and enlivened the deadened ones to build a tabernacle for him. this tabernacle is the incarnated God coming to live among man and even become the enterable one.
