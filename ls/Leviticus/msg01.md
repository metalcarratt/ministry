Gods revelation in the bible is progressive:
- in genesis god created man but man fell and rebelled against God. God came in to call a called race, but this race also fell into egypt. the end of genesis is a man in a coffin.
- in exodus God saved and redeemed his people in egypt and enlivened the deadened ones to build a tabernacle for him. this tabernacle is the incarnated God coming to live among man and even become the enterable one.
- in leviticus is how the redeemed people live and serve. to serve God is to enjoy a common portion with Him and fellowship with Hin.

the whole of leviticus was God's speaking. this speaking happened within the tabernacle. in genesis god was in the heavens, in exodus he spoke from the mountain, but at the end of exodus the tabernacle was built and in leviticus he spoke from the tabernacle.
