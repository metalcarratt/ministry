chs 18-20 are on the holy living of the holy people. this matches eph. 4:17 - 5:14 on putting off the old man with the former manner of life, and putting on the new man with the new manner of life.

not doing according to the customs of the egyptians or the canaanites. (the worldly and fleshly people) (18:3)

being holy because God is holy. (19:2, 20:7, 20:26)

offering the peace offering. (19:5). the peace offering is a type of the Lord's Table. the other four offerings deal with our negative situation that we can be brought into fellowship with God and the other believers.

the peace offering was not to be eaten or or after the third day. this symbolises that our enjoyment of the Lord should always be fresh, especially at the Lord's Table meeting.

Lev. 19:7
> But if it is eaten at all on the third day, it is an abomination; it will not be accepted.

> We should not have any stale practices at the Lord's table. We should not come to the Lord's table with anything stale. Rather, we should come with something new. For this, we need a new repentance, a new confession, a new dealing, and a new touch with the Lord. In other words, we need a new washing, a new bathing in the Word or in the Spirit, so that we can have a fresh rememberance of the Lord. When we have a fresh enjoyment of the Lord, He will also have a fresh enjoyment because of our fresh enjoyment.
