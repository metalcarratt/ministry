leprosy.

uncleanness from contact people comes from without, uncleanness from our nature come
from within. leprosy is an uncleanness that originates in an infection from
without but becomes something from within.

miriam (rebellion against moses), gehazi, elishas servant (rebellion against elisha),
and uzziah who tried to offer incense (rebellion against God's ordination for the
priests), and three examples of leprosy issuing from rebellion.

sin came into being through Satan. it was his invention through his rebellion against God. actually all sin is rebellion. sin is a matter of leprosy.

details:
- hair turning white - weakenkng of the strength to live
- deeper than the skin - the skn is hidden/covered and not confessed
- the skin becoming white, not deeper, hair not white - positvely our wrong behaviour not covered but confessed and our strength remaining
- diseased spot dading - the healing power of Christ's life in grace
- white swelling (rising), eruptions, bright spots - unruliness, friction with others, pride, self exaltation, lawlessness
- raw flesh - ?
- breaking out to cover the whole body from head to toe being clean - this is because it is fully exposed through a thorough confession to God.
