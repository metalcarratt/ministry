after all the offerings and the laws of the offerings, Aaron and his sons were
consecrated to be priests. consecration in hebrew means, "filling the hands". they
were consecrated by their hands being filled with the offerings. the spiritual
significance of leviticus is that we are all priests. at some point we need to
consecrate ourselves to the lord.

> we have been reborn, regenerated, to be priests. as long as we have been regenerated, we are real priests. however, we need a day of consecration on which we give ourselves to God and say, "Lord, I am Yours because You bought me. You redeemed me with your blood, and You have regenerated me. Now that I have your life and the enjoyment of Your redemption, I would like to offer myself to You. I give myself to serve You as Your servant, even as Your slave."

> we are a particular people--we are priests. all the offerings refer to Christ, and whatever Christ is to us and does for us is to constitute us priests.
