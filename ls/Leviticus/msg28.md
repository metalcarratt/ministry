after all the offerings and the laws of the offerings, Aaron and his sons were
consecrated to be priests. consecration in hebrew means, "filling the hands". they
were consecrated by their hands being filled with the offerings. the spiritual
significance of leviticus is that we are all priests. at some point we need to
consecrate ourselves to the lord.

> we have been reborn, regenerated, to be priests. as long as we have been regenerated, we are real priests. however, we need a day of consecration on which we give ourselves to God and say, "Lord, I am Yours because You bought me. You redeemed me with your blood, and You have regenerated me. Now that I have your life and the enjoyment of Your redemption, I would like to offer myself to You. I give myself to serve You as Your servant, even as Your slave."

> we are a particular people--we are priests. all the offerings refer to Christ, and whatever Christ is to us and does for us is to constitute us priests.

details:
- at the entrance of the tent of meeting (for the church life)
- washed by moses with water (washed by Christ with the Spirit)
- aaron dressed with the high priest garments (Christ adorned with the excellent divine and human attributes)
- aaron's sons dressed with the priestly garments (Christ dressing us with His divine attributes to be expressed through our human virtues). to serve God as a priests, going out to people, we need the proper expression. not only Christ adorns us, sometimes we adorn one another to serve properly as priests.
- anointing the tabernacle, the altar and the laver (our service as priests is in, for and as the church; the cross is the place where Christ became all the offerings as our provision; the laver is where we are washed of the Spirit; by anointing these three we are sanctified to be priests)
> one day, perhaps recently, you prayed, "Lord, I give myself to You absolutely." As long as you have prayed such a prayer, you have consecrated yourself to the Lord. God has accepted your consecration and has ordained you, filling your empty hands with Christ.
