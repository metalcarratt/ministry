the law of the sin offering


in the nt age we live by grace but the life within us has a law. even the way we
eat and enjoy the Lord has a law. Paul said he buffeted his body and made it a
slave. gal 5:16 "walk by this rule".

> the rule of the new creation will regulate us in the time we go to bed at night
