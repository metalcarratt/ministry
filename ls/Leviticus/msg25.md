the law of the sin offering


in the nt age we live by grace but the life within us has a law. even the way we
eat and enjoy the Lord has a law. Paul said he buffeted his body and made it a
slave. gal 5:16 "walk by this rule".

>
> Today we do not need circumcision or uncircumcision--we only need grace. But in verse 16 Paul goes on to tell us that the way to receive mercy and peace is to "walk by this rule", the rule of the new creation. God has saved us to the state and condition of a new creation with Christ as its life. Now we need to walk by the rule of this new creation.
>
> the rule of the new creation will regulate us in the time we go to bed at night and rise in the morning. on the Lord's Day in particular, the rule of the new creation will urge us to rise up a little earlier, pray for the meeting, and come to the meeting early to meet with the Lord and worship Him.
>
> the reward for walking according to the rule of the new creation is mercy and peace. I can testify that when I walk according to this rule, I have mercy and peace. If we walk according to the rule of the new creation in the way we prepare for and come to the meeting on the Lord's Day, we will receive mercy and peace.

the law, the sin offering is:
- before God
- on the place of the burnt offering (based on the burnt offering)
- holy (dealing with our nature)
- eaten by the priest (we who serve others through the gospel also enjoy it)
- in a holy place, the court (enjoyed in the realm of the church)
- whoever touches the flesh is holy (the effect on our nature through faith)
- the garment upon which the blood is splattered washed in a holy place (we should not consider the blood common, and should deal with our daily walk)
- the vessel it is boiled in broken (those who preach christ need their vessel brokwn)
