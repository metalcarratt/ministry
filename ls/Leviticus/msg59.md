God's word of warning to the children of Israel.

1. not to make any idols. this is not to have any goal other than God Himself.

2. to keep God's Sabbath. this is to rest in what God has accomplished for us.

> We need to learn the lesson to enjoy what God has achieved. This however is a hard lesson
