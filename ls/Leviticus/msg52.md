seven feasts in the year: four in the first part of the year, typifying things that
have already taken place; three in the last part of the year, typifying things that
will happen in the future.

### passover

the lords table is the replacement of the passover. the main thing we enjoy in
this feast is the lamb. he as the lamb redeemed us.

### feast of unleavened bread

immeidately follows the passover and is for seven days (our entire life). 

in this feast the main thing we enjoy is the unleavened bread, which is Christ 
as our food. He is the sinless One and as we enjoy Him we are strengthened to 
live a sinless life.

> the main thing we enjoy in the Passover is Christ as our Lamb. In the feast of unleavened bread, the main thing we enjoy is Christ as the unleavened bread, as our life supply without sin. Now for our whole Christian life we live day by day on this bread that is without sin.
