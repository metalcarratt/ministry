> taking Christ as our sin offering is not simply a matter of confessing our sins and having it dealt with. Taking Christ as our sin offering also means that our old man, Satan, the world, and the struggle for power are dealt with.

there are four sizes of the sin offering: a young bull, a buck of the goats, a ewe of the goats, or a female lamb.
the difference in size is not a difference with Christ but with our experience of Him.
if we only experience Him as the sin offering dealing with our sin we will have a small
offering, but if we experience Him as the sin offering overcoming Satan, the world, and the
struggle for power, we will have a larger offering.

the sin offering is without blemish signifying Christ who is without sin.
