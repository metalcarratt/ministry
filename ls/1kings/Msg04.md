Positive aspects of solomon - wisdom of God.

Paul had spiritual wisdom but solomon only had material wisdom.

John the baptist was the greatest ( hence greater than solomon ) but all of us in the kingdom of the heavens are greater than he.

Solomons large family required much tax which became a factor in him losing the kingdom.
