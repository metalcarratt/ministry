The palaces were for government, made of the same material as the temple, showing that they are one.
We are priests and kings to God.

Our prayer should be aimed at God's house, city and land, all of which typify Christ.
Whenever we pray for people we shpuld not pray *to* them but *to* god's interest on earth
