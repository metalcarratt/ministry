Israels history. Hidden God, preserving
and protecting His people, even in captivity.
Eventually He brought His people back.

The church became degraded. This is captivity.
We in the Lord's recovery are coming out of
this captivity 

Whenever we are not enjoying the Lord we are in
spiritual captivity. So we need to repent and
come back to Him.
