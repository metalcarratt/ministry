Job's response to his suffering was to curse the day of his birth. this is, essentially,
the same as cursing his mother. he also said he preffered darkness than light and
death than life. he said that sighing was his food and groaning his water.

since the day Paul was saved he also suffered much, but he did not curse the day of
his birth, nor say that he preferred to die rather than live. instead he lived a crucified
life. he wanted to live because for him to live was Christ.

paul was pressed on every side but not constricted. he was cast down but not destroyed.
he was well pleased in distresses, conformed to the mould of the death of Christ, bearing about
in the body the putting to death of Jesus, his outer man being consummed but hiz
inner man being renewed.
