Job's response:
- challenging God to cut him off
- asking God how much He would require of him

this is different from Paul's attitude when facing matyrdom.

- insisting he was not wrong and asking to be taught how he had erred
- loathing life

God's stripping being that Job would seek and gain only God Hinself.

God could not speak of His economy to Job and his friends because their spiritual culture was very primitive. we need to enjoy and experience Christ so that when we meet we can speak and fellowship something positive to one another, ministering Christ to one another.
