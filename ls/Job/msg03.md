Satan fell into God's trap. also, no matter how much he may have desired to
destroy God's people, everything he could do was within the limit set by God.

after the first occurance (losing his possesions and children) he blessed God.
after the second occurance (covered in boil) he became silent but to his
wife said should we expect to have the good without the evil, indicating he did
not have a commercial mentality like Satan. after his friends came and sat with him
in silence, since he would not curse God he instead cursed himself, cursing the
day of his birth.
