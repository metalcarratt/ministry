In Job's concept:
- God had subverted justice
- walled up his way and put darkness on his paths
- stripped him of his glory and crown - this was true
- plucked up his hope
- kindled His anger against him, considered him an adversary, and sent His troop against him
- removed his brothers, relatives, maids from him
- estranged him from his wife and caused little children to despise him

Job was sensitive, thinking God was against him and accusing his friends and others of wanting to damage him. Paul, by contrast rejoiced in all that happened to him (Phil 4:4).
