Eliphaz's rebuke of Job.

Job was suffering but Eliphaz did not minister anything to him. this should warn
us that in the meetings and when prophecying we should speak something to minister
life to one another.

Eliphaz advised Job to commit his cause to God, but this did supply anything to Job.

Eliphaz considered Job as being under God's chastising and advised him to not
rejecting God's hand. this was an inaccurate diagnosis by a "useless physician".
