to understand the book of Job we need to understand God's economy, which is His household
law for disoensing Himself into His people. based on this economy, Christ was
incarnated, died and resurrected, became the life-giving Spirit, was begotten as the
firstborn son, regenerated us as the many sons, made us member of His Body, thr New Man,
and the New Jerusalem.

God was trying to rescue Job and his friends from the realm of the tree of knowledge.
to do this He had to strip Job, consume him and tear him down. this is the base for
him to be rebuilt with the divine trinity to become the new man.
