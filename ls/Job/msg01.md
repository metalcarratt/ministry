Ezk 14:22
> Yet there will be a remnant left in it that will be brought forth, both sons and daughters. They will come forth to you, and you will see their ways and their doings; and you will be comforted for the ill that I have brought upon Jerusalem, for all that I have brought upon it.

Ezk 14:23
> And they will comfort you when you see their ways and their doings; and you will know that it was not without cause that I have done all that I have done to it, declares the Lord Jehovah.

Job and his friends regarded what happened to Job as God's judgment but actually it
was God's strippingm in our spiritual dictionary, the first word should be Christ
and the second word should be stripping. the more stripping we have the more
growth in Christ we have.
