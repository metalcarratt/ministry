Job had the question, why was he suffering. the whole new testament is God's
answer to Job's question. specifically this answer is in the incarnation, human
living, death, resurrection and ascension of the Lord Jesus, and in His forming the
church as the new man, the body of Christ, and consummating in the New Jerusalem.
it is His economy to dispense Himself into His people to make them His corporate expression.
