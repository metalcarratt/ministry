jesus is the very God, the creator. he is also a man with flesh and blood. even in
resurrection he appeared to his disciples and told them to behold him having flesh and bones
and asked Thomas to put his hand into his side. however he is also the spirit in us.
we cannot understand how someone with flesh and blood can be inside us but this is the fact
in the bible.

there are mainly two kinds of religion in Christianity, the religion of teachings and the religion of miracles. heb 8:11 and 1 John 2:27 say we don't need teachings because we have the anointing in us. many are obsessed with tongue speaking and prophecies but the bible mainly focusing on the indwelling christ.
