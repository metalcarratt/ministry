jesus is the very God, the creator. he is also a man with flesh and blood. even in
resurrection he appeared to his disciples and told them to behold him having flesh and bones
and asked Thomas to put his hand into his side. however he is also the spirit in us.
we cannot understand how someone with flesh and blood can be inside us but this is the fact
in the bible.

there are mainly two kinds of religion in Christianity, the religion of teachings and the religion of miracles. heb 8:11 and 1 John 2:27 say we don't need teachings because we have the anointing in us. many are obsessed with tongue speaking and prophecies but the bible mainly focusing on the indwelling christ.

a human baby has a human nature. if you put something sweet in its mouth it will eat it but if you put something bitter it will spit it out. in the same way we have the nature of the uplifted humanity of Jesus in us. no matter how spiritually young we are, this nature knows what it likes and dislikes.

the working of this nature in us is the law of the spirit of life. it is also the anointing. the anointing is the moving of a person in us, a person who teaches us all things.
