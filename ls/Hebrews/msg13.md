as our high priest, christ is merciful and faithful. merciful is related to his humanity
and faithful is related to his divinity. although someone may have a good intention to
do something, without the ability they cannot do it. christ is faithful because he has
the ability to do what he has promised. we have God's divinity but we are not almighty.
since christ is the almighty God he can be faithful.
