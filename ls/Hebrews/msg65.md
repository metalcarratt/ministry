the fact that christ is the firstborn son proves that he has undergone a process.
John 1:14 says the word became flesh, and 1 cor 15:45 says the last Adam became
 life giving spirit. christ is God who became flesh and the spirit. but he did not
 stop being God or a man. example is water with tea and milk added. the water, tea
 and milk are all still present, but it is clearly different from before.

 God is on the throne far away from us so how can he save us to the uttermost? because
 he is also the spirit inside of us. this is like electricity being in our home and
 the power plant at the same time.

 it is impossible to imitate God. we need the Son as the prototype who is the spirit
 in us. he as tea needs to be mingled with us as water.

 the only begotten son became the firstborn son. this means he took on humanity and
 later sonised this humanity. now he is the prototype in us to do the same thing in us.
 the way to experience this is to set our mind on the spirit no matter what we are doing.
