```
we must be governed
by a controlling vision
that captures our heart
and directs our way
that we would live
not to ourselves
but to him who has died for us
and has been raised.

the god of the universe
who formed us
and knew us from our mother's womb
in whom is our breath

Being great
- Having therefore a great high priest (Heb 4:14)
  
Being God
- But of the Son, Your throne, O God, is forever and ever (Heb 1:8)
  
Incarnated to be a man
- Since therefore the children have shared in blood and flesh, He also Himself in like manner partook of the same (Heb 2:14)
  
Human living
- For we do not have a High Priest who cannot be touched with the feeling of our weaknesses, but One who has been tempred in all respects like us, yet without sin (Heb 4:15)
- He is also able to help those who are being tempted (Heb 2:18)
  
Death
- Having made purification for sins (Heb 1:3)
- He might taste death on behalf of everything (Heb 2:9)
- that through death He might destroy him who has the might of death, that is, the devil (Heb 2:14)
- and might release those who because of the fear of death through all their life were held in slavery (Heb 2:15)
- Stripping off the rulers and the authorities, He made a display of them openly, triumphing over them in it (Col 2:15)
  
Raised
- Whom God has raised up, having loosed the pangs of death, since it was not possible for Him to be held by it (Acts 2:24)
  
Ascension
- Having therefore a great High Priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus, the Son of God (Heb 4:14)
  
Enthronement
- sat down on the right hand of the majesty on high (Heb 1:3)
- crowned with glory and honor (Heb 2:9)
- far above all rule and authority and power and lordship and every name that is named not only in this age but also in that which is to come (Eph 1:21)
  
Ministering
- But Christ was faithful as a Son over His house, whose house we are (Heb 3:6)
- within the veil, where the forerunner, Jesus, has entered for us, having become forever a High Priest according to the order of Melchizedek (Heb 6:19-20)
- For Christ did not enter a holy place made by hands...but into heaven itself, to appear now before the face of God for us (Heb 9:24)
