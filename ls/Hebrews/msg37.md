heb 8 is all about the law of life. how do we know the law spoken of here is
the law of life? because if it were not it could not be put into our mind and heart.

after christ ascended he began interceeding. all our responses on earth are due ti his heavenly interceeding.

one of his laws will get into our mind and renew it. then we will think differently because of this new law. another law will get into our emotion. we will no longer love or hate as before. our love will be regulated by this law.
