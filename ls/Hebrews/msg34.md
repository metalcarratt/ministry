three aspects of the priesthood:
- aaronic, concerned with offerings for sin
- kingly, concerned with ministering the life supply
- divinely, concerned with saving to the uttermost.

christs saving saves us especially from death and the environment of death.

the best worship we can give God is to eat and drink him as the bread and wine.

since the aaronic priesthood deals with sins and the kingly priesthood give us life, why do we still need another priesthood? because sin has brought in death. the issue of sin is death and death has permeated all things. in a broad sense, death includes vanity, corruption, sighing, groaning and decay. all forms of worldy entertainment are just a drug to cover up the feeling of death.

> The Aaronic priesthood solves the problem of sin, whereas the kingly priesthood fulfills God's eternal purpose. The Aaronic priesthood took away sin, and the kingly priesthood brought in God as our grace.

> Why then is there the need for the third aspect of the priesthood, the divine priesthood? Although sin is over, it cause a tremendous result--death. According to Romans 5, the issue of sin is death. We should not understand death according to the narrow view of our human concept. According to the broadest understanding of death in the Bible, death includes vanity, corruption, sighing, groaning, and decay. Everything is decaying. You may have a strong body, but before too long it begins to decay. The matters of vanity, corruption, bondage, groaning, and decay are fully developed and covered in Romans 8. In Romans 5 we have sin and death; in Romans 8 we have vanity, corruption, bondage, groaning, and decay. The whole univsere has been polluted by death, which is the result of the sin that came in through Adam, the head of the old creation. What is the pollution that comes from death, the result of sin? It is corruption, vanity, decay, and groaning. Romans 8:22 says that the entire creation is groaning. Why do people today have so many sports and entertainments? Because they, along with the whole creation, are sick and are groaning. Every person is groaning deepwithin. Since people want to escape from this groaning, they go dancing or partake of other wordly entertainments. All of these entertainments are drugs, like opium, that take away the feeling of the sickness. But opium does not heal; it merely drugs you. The dancing and all sports and entertainments are drugs. When many people come home from dancing or from a sporting event, they find that the inward groaning is still there. The only thing that has changed is that they have been drugged. Education is also a drug. Although you may attan the highest degree, once you have graduated, you will say, "What is this?" and will throw away your diploma. This groaning is one of the issues of death.





> we all have life and death within us. even your losing your temper or feeling unhappy with the brothers and sisters is death. your inability to praise, pray, or function in the meetings also is death. life never says, "I can't." in life's dictionary there are no such words as "I can't." life always says, "I can. I can do everything. I can function. I can pray. I can shout. I can say amen, and I can praise." whenever you say "I can" that is life. whenever you say "I cant" that is death. in the church life from now on you must avoid saying "I cant".
