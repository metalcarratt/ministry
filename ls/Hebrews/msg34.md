three aspects of the priesthood:
- aaronic, concerned with offerings for sin
- kingly, concerned with ministering the life supply
- divinely, concerned with saving to the uttermost.

christs saving saves us especially from death and the environment of death.

the best worship we can give God is to eat and drink him as the bread and wine.

since the aaronic priesthood deals with sins and the kingly priesthood give us life, why do we still need another priesthood? because sin has brought in death. the issue of sin is death and death has permeated all things. in a broad sense, death includes vanity, corruption, sighing, groaning and decay. all forms of worldy entertainment are just a drug to cover up the feeling of death.
