three aspects of the priesthood:
- aaronic, concerned with offerings for sin
- kingly, concerned with ministering the life supply
- divinely, concerned with saving to the uttermost.

christs saving saves us especially from death and the environment of death.

the best worship we can give God is to eat and drink him as the bread and wine.
