christ is not only kingly but divine. divinity is his life and nature. because he is life, where he is there is no death. the priesthood of christ is the absence of death.

because he is the indestructible life he is able to save us to the uttermost.

we are full of a better hope, the priesthood in life. don't believe in the lie that we are weak. if we remain in life we have a better hope.

the lord has pledged himself to us. he is the surety of the new covenant. he is fully able and pledged to fulfill all the new covenant in us. 

he is able to save to the uttermost. completely, entirely and perfectly, for all time.
