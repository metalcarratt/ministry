the church is mentioned only twice in hebrews, once in 2:12. the revelation here
is profound, that the church is the composition of brothers of the firstborn son of
God. the firstborn son of God has both the divine and human nature's and so do all
his brothers. we should never think a church in a locality is poor. it is a living
organism that may get "tired" but that is composed of the two highest lives in the
universe: the divine life and the uplifted resurrected human life.

> whenever we come to the meetings, we must open out mouths to praise the Father. If we do this immediately, we will cooperate with the Firstborn Son of God. Do you want to gain more of the Firstborn Son of God? If you do you need to praise the Father. The more we praise the Father the more we gain the Firstborn Son. The more we sing the more He sings in our singing. The best way to have Christ's working together with us is by singing praises to the Father. According to our experience, many of us can testify that this is so. In some of the church meetings we did much singing to the Father. That was the time we enjoyed Christ so much. We even had the sensation that He was signing in our singing.
