the church is mentioned only twice in hebrews, once in 2:12. the revelation here
is profound, that the church is the composition of brothers of the firstborn son of
God. the firstborn son of God has both the divine and human nature's and so do all
his brothers. we should never think a church in a locality is poor. it is a living
organism that may get "tired" but that is composed of the two highest lives in the
universe: the divine life and the uplifted resurrected human life.
