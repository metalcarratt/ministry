the race we are running is to stay in the holy of holies. the holy of holies in the tabernacle
became larger in the temple and even larger again in the nj. thus as we go on in thus race
the holy of holies increases in size.

1 cor 15:10 "not I but the grace of god" with gal 2:20, "not I but christ lives in me"
shows that grace is a person, christ

to fall from grace is to be severed from christ.

root of bitterness - some in the churches poison others by their bitterness. we should reject what the opposers say. if we leave the church life we will be leaving grace.

> we should not listen to the roots of bitterness, for their intention is to damage the lords recovery. the root of bitterness can cause us to fall away from the grace of god. I have the full assurance that the lords recovery is the best place to enjoy grace today. if you leave the lords recovery, you will surely fall away from the grace of god. deep within our spirit, we know that before we came to the church we never experienced grace like we do now. do not care for what the opposers say, care for your experience. the opposers always try to stir up your mentality, just like the serpent stirred up Eve's mind. once they have stirred up your mentality to think things over, they will poison you with their talk. as a result, you will either leave the lords recovery, or else you will be cold and negative concerning it.
