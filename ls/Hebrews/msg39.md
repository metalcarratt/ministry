the hold place typifies the old covenant and is a figure of the true things. the 
holy of holies typifies the new covenant and is the reality. in the holy of holies
we have God's presence, God's speaking, God's meeting and fellowshipping with us,
and we are enjoying all the bequests of the new covenant, such as God writing His
laws into our heart, being our God, us knowing Him, and His blood purifying us.
