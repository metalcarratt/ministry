gods speaking. god is always speaking. if he does not speak it is an indication
we may be under a curse such as at elis timw, but if we are under blessing we will
have God's continual speaking. when he speaks he doesn't give up. he demands we be
obedient to his speaking.

his speaking causes his transfusion. the more he speaks the more his divine element
gets infused into us.

with his speaking comes light. if we have light we will have much to say. the reason people come to church meetings and don't speak is because they are in darkness.
