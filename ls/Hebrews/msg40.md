in exodus it says the incense altar was placed in the holy place but in hebrews
it says it belongs to the holy of holies. why is this? in exodus it actually says
the incense altar was placed before the veil that was "over" the ark of the testimony.
the sense of "over" is not that of separating the ark from the altar, but covering
the ark. another portion of exodus says the altar was placed before the ark without reference
to the veil. we know when christ died the veil was rent and also in revelation we see
the golden altar before the throne. this shows that they belong together and it was
only the old dispensation that caused a covered to be placed over the ark. 1 kings
also mentions the altar belonged to the "oracle."

the incense altar is related to prayer and to pray is to enter the holy of holies. we pray with christ as our incense and he replies by the sweet smell of the incense we burn.
