the hebrew believers were attracted away from christ by the feasts in judaism.
Christmas is the same in principle. we need to hold fast to christ and to the
church life. 

the lord was slain on the altar, outside the gate, and his blood was brought into
the holy of holies to sanctify us. we need to follow him on the pathway of the cross
by going outside the camp unto him. this means we must drop every religious practice.
here we also have no earthly city but seek after the new jerusalem.
