> enjoying christ as the hidden manna is not a sudden experience; it must have a history behind it.

the hidden manna was one tenth, signifying the top portion. after we enjoy the open manna God invites us into the holy of holies to enjoy the top portion.

enjoying the hidden manna in the golden pot is a matter of touching Christ in His divinity, and a matter of being hidden in ht eholy of holies with our high priest, far away from everything of the world. if we are fighting with the brothers, or involved in loose joking, or being religious, we cannot enjoy this hidden manna. if we are bothered by people or situations we cannot be in our spirit. we must be beyond all situations to enjoy the hidden manna.
