nothing offends god more than unbelief. we need to know not only the acts of God but his ways.
he has principles, will never deny himself, and is faithful in always keeping his promises
and fulfilling his word.

our heart is evil and is often hardened toward God. we need to often pray for the lord to
soften our heart. our heart tries God, puts him to the test, and is self deceiving. 
eventually it produces unbelief. 

> unbelief is so evil because it insults the living, faithful and almighty God. if we do not believe in God, in His work, and in His ways, we insult Him. This is why we must beware of unbelief. ... Our God is living and has His principles in doing things. He will never deny Himself. He is able, almighty, and faithful, always keeping His promises and fulfilling His Word.

> How dangerous it is for our heart to be hardened! We need to pray again and again for the Lord to soften our heart, saying, "Lord, have mercy on me. Soften my heart and never allow it to be hardened."

the living word of God

> whenever we read the bible it must be living, energizing, and sharp enough to divide and discern all the things within us. if it is not, we have not touched the word of god but only black and white letters. the printed matter in black and white letters is neither living nor energizing every word in the bible must be the living and operating word of god. how do we know that we have touched the word of god and not just the printed matter? we know it when the word we have touched is living, energizing, and dividing our soul from our spirit. this is an important principle.

our spirit may be clear but our mind causes our soul to wander and our soul becomes "sticky", sticking to our spirit. thr word must come in to pierce and separate our spirit from our soul.
