nothing offends god more than unbelief. we need to know not only the acts of God but his ways.
he has principles, will never deny himself, and is faithful in always keeping his promises
and fulfilling his word.

our heart is evil and is often hardened toward God. we need to often pray for the lord to
soften our heart. our heart tries God, puts him to the test, and is self deceiving. 
eventually it produces unbelief.
