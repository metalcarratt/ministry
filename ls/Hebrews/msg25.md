nothing offends god more than unbelief. we need to know not only the acts of God but his ways.
he has principles, will never deny himself, and is faithful in always keeping his promises
and fulfilling his word.

our heart is evil and is often hardened toward God. we need to often pray for the lord to
soften our heart. our heart tries God, puts him to the test, and is self deceiving. 
eventually it produces unbelief. 

> unbelief is so evil because it insults the living, faithful and almighty God. if we do not believe in God, in His work, and in His ways, we insult Him. This is why we must beware of unbelief. ... Our God is living and has His principles in doing things. He will never deny Himself. He is able, almighty, and faithful, always keeping His promises and fulfilling His Word.

> How dangerous it is for our heart to be hardened! We need to pray again and again for the Lord to soften our heart, saying, "Lord, have mercy on me. Soften my heart and never allow it to be hardened."
