We have a great High Priest
An excellent One in us
Your throne, O God
Is forever and ever (H1:8)
You partook of blood and flesh
In like manner with us (H2:14)
You were tempted in all respects like us
Yet without sin 
You can be touched with the feeling of our weaknesses (H4:15)
Our merciful High Priest.

We have a great High Priest
An excellent One in us
You tasted death for all things (H2:9)
Making purification for sins (H1:3)
You destroyed him who has the might of death (H2:14)
Stripping off the rulers and authorities
You made a display of them openly
Triumphing over them in it (Col2:15)
Releasing us from the fear of death (H2:15)
Our victorious High Priest

We have a great High Priest
An excellent One in us
You whom God has raised, since it was not possible
For You to be held by death (Acts2:24)

And were crowned with glory and  honor (H2:9)
Far above all rule and authority and power
And every name that is named (Eph1:21)
You sat down on the right hand
Of the majesty on high (Heb1:3)
Our kingly High Priest

We have a great High Priest
An excellent One in us
You have entered a holy place
Within the veil, into heaven itself 
Appearing now before the face of God (H9:24;6:19-20)
Bearing us on your shoulders and breast (Exo28:12,29)
Interceeding now for us (Heb7:25)
You are faithful over all Your house
Whose house we are (H3:6)
Our faithful High Priest

An excellent One in us
You became a priest according to the order of melchizedek, (H6:20)
The king of righteousness, the king of peace (H7:2)
Having neither beginning of days nor end of life
You abide a Priest perpetually (H7:3)
You bring out bread and wine (Gen14:18-19)
The bread your body given for us, (Matt26:26-27)
the bread of life supplying us, (John6:35)
the cup the blood poured out for us (Matt26:28)
You spread a table in the midst of our adversaries (Psa23:5)
Our ministering High Priest.
