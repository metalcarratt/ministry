sabbath rest. example of god resting on seventh day. he did not rest because he had
finished his work, but because he had attained what he desired.

the real significance of the sabbath is that God is at rest when there is man on
the earth who expresses and represents him.

our rest today is in the church life. christ is our rest, and we can enjoy him as the one comforting us in our trials, but we should not do so selfishly. we must be in the place where gods expression and representation can be. that is in the church life. only then can we truly enter into God's rest.
