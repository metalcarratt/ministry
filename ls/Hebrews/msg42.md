conclusion of heb 7-9 is at end of ch 9. it is the two manifestations of christ
(his first and second comings) and the interval inbetween.

in the first manifestation Christ took away our sins and accomplished an eternal
redemption for us. all he has done has become a new Testament, something bequeathed
to us and that we can enjoy right away by faith. 

after his first manifestation christ is in heaven before the face of God, interceeding
for us. he is also working as the spirit to write the law of the spirit of life
into our inward being to make us the same as him. 

in his second manifestation christ will glorify us and bring us into the full sonship.
