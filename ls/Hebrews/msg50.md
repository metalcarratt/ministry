the way is christ. in the old Testament, before christ came, God gave many types of this way.
however the consummate type was the tabernacle in the Jewish religion. when the lord
came, he was not in the temple with the priests but in the house of Simon. the jews
were distracted from the way by the type. eventually the disciples began to take
this way and Saul became one persecuting them, trying to get them off the way. thus
the way became a race. they had to run on this way. Saul was knocked down, put on this
way and became paul. he must have considered hard the judaism he was on and realized
it was a distraction from the way. thus he also learned to run. if we walk we may get
distracted and leave the way. but if we run we have our eyes fixed on the goal.

look away from all distracting things to the christ on the throne. he is a great magnet, drawing us to himself.
