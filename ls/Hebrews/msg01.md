a hebrew is a river crosser. babylon was a place of idolatry, and what separated that
place from the good land, where gods sanctuary was, was a river. we are all those who
have crossed that river to come into a good land.

the principle is the same with our baptism. also Noah, who's flood separated him from the devilish world and he built an altar. after leaving Egypt the children of israel crossed the red sea and there they built the tabernacle.

we are the real Hebrews, those who have crossed the sea of baptism. in revelation the overcomers stood upon the glassy sea mixed with fire, and in both the tabernacle and the temple there is a laver/brass sea before the entrance.
