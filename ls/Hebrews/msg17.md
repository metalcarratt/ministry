man is created out of the dust of the ground and is thus tied to the land. when
man sinned it affected the land and when the death waters covered the land it was
a judgement of mankind. however christ is our good land that resurrected out of the
death waters. he is the land of Canaan surrounded on all sides by the waters of death.
now we are joined to him, rooted in him and growing in him.

this is a foretaste of the new jerusalem in the church life.
