christ is objectively in heaven but subjectively in us. he is the ladder that joins
heaven to earth at bethel, the house of god. thus three times in hebrews we are exhorted
to come forward: to the throne of grace (4:16), the holy of holies (10:22) and to God
(7:25, 11:6). God is on the throne of grace in the holy of holies, all of which is
objectively in heaven, but because christ is our ladder we can come forward today by
exercising our spirit.

when melchizedek met Abraham he was not a poor sinner needing redemption but a victorious
fighter who had just come back from slaughtering chedorlaomer and rescuing lot.

> when melchizedek came to Abraham, Abraham was not a pitiful sinner, begging, "o priest melchizedek, be merciful to me. look at how sinful I am. you need to take care of my sins. my situation is so poor. you need to bring all the offerings to God for me." Abraham was not in such a situation. when melchizedek came to him, Abraham was the victor, the fighter, the slaughterer. Abraham had just slaughtered chedorlaomer and the other kings. Abraham was a victorious fighter who had taken many spoils. what are you--poor sinners or victorious fighters? I am glad to say that in the church life we are not pitiful sinners but victorious fighters.

> in the book of hebrews, melchizedek is our high priest. we do not want to linger in leviticus but go all the way back to the beginning of Genesis. this is a real recovery. let us go back to Genesis 14 where we see that the priest did not offer sacrifices for pitiful sinners but ministered bread and wine to glorious victors.
