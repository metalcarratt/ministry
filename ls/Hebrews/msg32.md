christ is objectively in heaven but subjectively in us. he is the ladder that joins
heaven to earth at bethel, the house of god. thus three times in hebrews we are exhorted
to come forward: to the throne of grace (4:16), the holy of holies (10:22) and to God
(7:25, 11:6). God is on the throne of grace in the holy of holies, all of which is
objectively in heaven, but because christ is our ladder we can come forward today by
exercising our spirit.

when melchizedek met Abraham he was not a poor sinner needing redemption but a victorious
fighter who had just come back from slaughtering chedorlaomer and rescuing lot.

> > n the book of hebrews, melchizedek is our high priest. we do not want to linger in leviticus
