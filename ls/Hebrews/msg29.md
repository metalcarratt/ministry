word of righteousness. not milk, the rudimentary things, but solid food. related to
gods governmental dealing. for example Miriam touched God's authority and became leprosy
and could not enter the good land. Moses and Aaron were the same. all the words in
hebrews about not entering his rest and not hardening our hearts are words of righteousness.

> in these messages the lord has released a solemn word to us. we must cross the river and go on. do not fool around with the Lord.
