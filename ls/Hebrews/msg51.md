"make straight paths" means not to make any compromise in following the way of the
new covenant. for the Hebrew believers to appease their relative by attending the
temple, or for us to "shake hands over the fence" with the denominations, is to add curves
in the path of the new covenant way.

we need to pursue peace and holiness together. our pursuing peace with all men should be balanced by our holiness, a holiness that comes out of our dwelling in the holy of holies. in this way there is no compromise. the elders in a local church should have such a peace among them.
