we are the brothers of the firstborn son. since he is the firstborn we are the many
born. we are not adopted sons but born sons, the same as Him. He as come into our
spirit that we might be born sons of God. he is perfect and complete in our spirit
but we are missing him in our mind, emotion and will. too often we live by our mind,
emotion and will but not by Him in our spirit. so we need to turn to our spirit
all the time.

as this law spreads in us it makes us the same as Him. we don't need teachings to
teach us how to behave. we need to let this life to spread into our mind, emotion
and will. As this law He is spreading into our mind, emotion, will to make it
exactly the same as He is.

the way to have this spreading is by eating the hidden manna.
