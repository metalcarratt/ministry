beginning of heb 10 is a further word on the sacrifice for sin accomplished by the
lord. Jeremiah is quoted again concerning the new covenant, and shows that the
sacrifice for sin is the last of the four items (the law of the spirit of life, God
being our God, and knowing god) and is the least important. God has not only
forgiven us but forgotten our sins.
