7:1 is a turn from christs ministry on earth (typified by aaron) to his ministry from heaven (typified by melchizedek):
- from purification of sins to sitting down at the right hand
- forgiveness of sins to overcoming of sin
- cross delivering us from Egypt to his throne bringing us into Canaan
- from the outer court (earth) to the holy of holies (heaven)
- from the altar (the cross) to the propitiation cover (the throne of grace)
- from the christ on earth to the christ in heaven
- from the suffering Jesus to the glorified christ on the throne
