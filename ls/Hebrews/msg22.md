three stages of the universe:
- before the creation of man, the stage of creation and the fall
- from the creation of man to the end of the millennium, the stage of accomplishing, lasting approximately 7000 years
- the new heaven and new earth, the eternal sabbath rest

the lords second coming is not the end of his working. there is still another 1000 years needed for further work. at the end, satan, the rebellious human nature, and death will all be dealt with and the old heaven and earth will be made new. additionally the sea will be no more in the new heaven and new earth, and the dead unbelievers will be judged at the great white throne after the millennium.

the church is the real sabbath rest, but the wedding feast during the millennium will be a better sabbath. however the ultimate sabbath rest will be after the millennium.
