# three stages of the sabbath rest
children of israel were gods rest, because through them he could build the temple for
his expression and administration. we may see many negative things about Israel, but
God came down as the shekinah glory to fill the temple. this fulfilled his purpose in
creating the earth.

the lord Jesus was God's rest. he said in him I find delight. this means he was satisfied and found rest in Jesus.

as gods house the church is also his rest and our rest.

the church is the kingdom of God today and the place of God's rest.
> in Matthew 11:28-30 the Lord Jesus said that if we were heavy laden and would come to him, he would be our rest, and in Matthew 12:8 he said that he was the lord of the sabbath. where is this christ who is our rest and who is the lord of the sabbath? he is in the church. if we would take christ as our rest, we must be in the church. the book of revelation mentions clearly that this christ, the all-inclusive one, is now walking in the midst of the lampstands, that is, among the churches. not only is he walking among the churches, but as revelation 2 and 3 reveal, he is the spirit speaking to the churches. if you want to touch him, enjoy him, and partake of him as your rest, you need to be in the church. the church is our sabbath today. if you apply this concept to all the verses in Isaiah concerning the sabbath, you will see how meaningful it is. how do we keep the sabbath today? by having the church life. oh, how we need to have the church life! we are the real sabbath keepers; we keep the sabbath day by day. what a sabbath we are enjoying today! what a rest this is!
