children of israel were gods rest, because through them he could build the temple for
his expression and administration. we may see many negative things about Israel, but
God came down as the shekinah glory to fill the temple. this fulfilled his purpose in
creating the earth.

the lord Jesus was God's rest. he said in him I find delight. this means he was satisfied and found rest in Jesus.
