christ is our high priest. as our high priest his main location is in the holy of
holies, standing at the right hand of the throne of god. he bears us on his shoulders
and on his breast (in his strength and love). and his function is to minister God to
us. he does this by being the heavenly ladder who is both in the holy of holies in the 
heavens and in our spirit at the same time.

we need to go on in our experience from the outer court and the holy place to experience
christ as our high priest in the holy of holies. "my grace is sufficient for you."
