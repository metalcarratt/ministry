christ is our high priest. as our high priest his main location is in the holy of
holies, standing at the right hand of the throne of god. he bears us on his shoulders
and on his breast (in his strength and love). and his function is to minister God to
us. he does this by being the heavenly ladder who is both in the holy of holies in the 
heavens and in our spirit at the same time.

we need to go on in our experience from the outer court and the holy place to experience
christ as our high priest in the holy of holies. "my grace is sufficient for you."

as our high priest, he:
- has both the human and divine nature's and knows both the things of God and the things of man.
- solved the problem of sin, conquered and subdued death, and is leading us into rest
- has attained the highest position in the universe
- has passed through the heavens, stripping of the rulers and authorities, made a show of them and triumphed over them
- has been tried in all respects but without sin
