the lord is working in us to bring us into glorification. perfection is not to be
sinless but to be saturated with glory. if we were only sinless we would be like a
blank paper, but God wants to work His Son, the model, into us, to sonize us, which
is to glorify us. this is to be perfect.

the law of life operates in us to glorify us, to conform us to the law of his life,
and the sense of life stirs in us, motivating us to seek him.
