history of faith:
- Noah prepared an ark when there was no rain
- Abraham waited for the heavenly city, jerusalem. he was a stranger and sojourner on the earth
- Jacob also leaned on his staff, signifying he considered himself a sojourner, not a dweller.
- Moses chose to be ill treated with the people of God than enjoy the pleasures of sin
- he also considered the reproach of christ greater than the treasures of egypt. this shows christ as the angel of god was with him.

although many saw gods miracles by faith many others did not. even when the lord was dying on the cross, for three hours God was silent while those watching mocked him. we may prefer gods miracles over his silence, but many of those matyred for him enjoyed his silence, preferring to be married for him. they did not accept deliverance in order to obtain the out resurrection. of them the world was not worthy. only the holy city of God, new jerusalem is worthy of them.

"apart from us they should not be made perfect" - because the kingdom and nj are both corporate the ot saints need the nt ones to perfect them.

the ot saints eagerly awaited to see the new covenant promises. we should never think it would have been better to live in the ot age.
