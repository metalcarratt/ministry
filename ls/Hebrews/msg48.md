history of faith:
- Noah prepared an ark when there was no rain
- Abraham waited for the heavenly city, jerusalem. he was a stranger and sojourner on the earth
- Jacob also leaned on his staff, signifying he considered himself a sojourner, not a dweller.
- Moses chose to be ill treated with the people of God than enjoy the pleasures of sin
- he also considered the reproach of christ greater than the treasures of egypt. this shows christ as the angel of god was with him.
