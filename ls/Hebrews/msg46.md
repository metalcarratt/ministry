matter of punishment and reward in the bible. gods goal for us is for us all to
become like his firstborn son. we must reach this goal. but if we reach it in this
age we will have a reward, to enjoy that goal in the coming kingdom. if we do not
we will have punishment yet still have to reach that goal.

our salvation is eternal and based on faith not on works. but the matter of reward
is a matter of our living and works.
