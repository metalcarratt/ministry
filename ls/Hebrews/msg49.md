the witnesses of faith form a cloud. the Lord himself is with his people in
the cloud. in the church we have the witnesses of faith. if we come to the church
we can find the lord because he is with his people of faith.

the lord is the author, pioneer, of faith. his life in the gospels was a life of faith.
every time he encountered an obstacle he cut a way of faith. now, as the author of faith
he can transfuse and infuse us with the faith he has cut.

> as the law of life works within us to bring about the expression and testimony of God, the first issue of its working is our believing. the most believing person is the one in whom the law of life has worked the most. 


> when the law of life operates within us to make us the very reflection, expression, and testimony of God, we find it easy to believe. our believing is spontaneous. in fact we are unable to disbelieve, because the believing ability has been wrought into us. now we can see why we must look away from all things unto Jesus, the author and perfector of our faith. when we look away unto him, we give him the opportunity and the freedom to work himself into us. in this way the law of life can work in every inward part of our being until we are fully saturated with him. the more we are saturated with him, the easier it is to believe. this is the way to have faith. May we all experience faith in such a subjective way by looking away unto Jesus.
