the witnesses of faith form a cloud. the Lord himself is with his people in
the cloud. in the church we have the witnesses of faith. if we come to the church
we can find the lord because he is with his people of faith.

the lord is the author, pioneer, of faith. his life in the gospels was a life of faith.
every time he encountered an obstacle he cut a way of faith. now, as the author of faith
he can transfuse and infuse us with the faith he has cut.
