all three of the items in the ark came from the israelites experiences in the wilderness;
the tablets with the law were given by God on the mountain, the hidden manna was taken
from the open manna, and the budding rod came out of the most serious experience of
rebellion.

within all of us are two things: Ambition and rebellion. this ambition is actually positive, for it is the positive desire to serve the lord and bring life to people. however it is ruined by rebellion. thus we need the Lord to crucify the rebellious element in us and resurrect the proper ambition which is Christ in us.
