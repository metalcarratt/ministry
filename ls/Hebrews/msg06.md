every day we need to cross a river. it may be a small river, such as offending our wife.
but if we do not cross it we will be stuck in the old religion on the other side.

two slogans:
- outside the camp
- within the veil

doctrines are like a vanity fair, selling nothing of value. we can either understand the trinity according to doctrine or experience.

christ our salvation is great as:

## God

## son of man

## captain
christ is the captain of our salvation, like Moses and Joshua leading the children of israel out of Egypt and into the good land. this shows salvation is not just redemption but to possess the good land. this needs warfare with a captain leading and even fighting the way in.

## high priest

ministers to us whatever we need, after we have fought with him.
