every day we need to cross a river. it may be a small river, such as offending our wife.
but if we do not cross it we will be stuck in the old religion on the other side.

two slogans:
- outside the camp
- within the veil

doctrines are like a vanity fair, selling nothing of value. we can either understand the trinity according to doctrine or experience.

christ our salvation is great as:

## God

## son of man

## captain
christ is the captain of our salvation, like Moses and Joshua leading the children of israel out of Egypt and into the good land. this shows salvation is not just redemption but to possess the good land. this needs warfare with a captain leading and even fighting the way in.

## high priest

ministers to us whatever we need, after we have fought with him.

his doings:
- purifying from sin
- tasting death for us
- destroying Satan to release us from slavery
- sanctifying us
- helping us

do not believe the enemy's lie. just declare the church is wonderful, my wife is the best wife. don't believe others who lie to you.


>  Christ is able to help us (Hebrews 2:18). He is able to help us to the uttermost. Do not listen to the lies. Do not listen to your environment, weakness, situation, or your husband or wife. Your wife or husband may be a little liar. Your sickness, weakness, and environment may also be lies. Do not believe the lie. The leading brothers should never listen to lies. Often the brothers and sisters are used by the enemy to lie to the leading brothers. For example, someone may say, “The church meeting is getting very low.” When someone says this, there is no need to argue with him. Just close your eyes and say, “This is a lie. Get away. I believe that the church is living and set on high.” This is faith. Try it and see. Sisters, if you say that your husband is no good, I can assure you that he will be no good simply because you have prophesied in such a way. You must cross the river. Do not believe that your husband is no good, but rather say, “My husband is the best one among all men.” If you say this, the Lord will come in to honor your prophecy and make your husband the best one. He is able to help us in all things. He is able to succor us in any kind of situation. 

Psalm 16:3
> As for the saints who are on the earth, they are the excellent; All my delight is in them.
