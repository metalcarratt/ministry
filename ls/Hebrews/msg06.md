every day we need to cross a river. it may be a small river, such as offending our wife.
but if we do not cross it we will be stuck in the old religion on the other side.

two slogans:
- outside the camp
- within the veil

doctrines are like a vanity fair, selling nothing of value. we can either understand the trinity according to doctrine or experience.
