christ is superior to the angels. when man was created he was destined for a future
superior to the angels, but he fell. eventually there was a prophecy that man would be
superior to the angels. when christ came he was adequate inferior in his outward body
but in his ascension he fulfilled that prophecy. now we are entering into that same prophecy.

me: angels are superior to us in outward things, we we are superior in the inward things.
we are becoming kings to rule and reign, whereas angels, not matter how outwardly
powerful they may seem, are still only ministering spirits.
