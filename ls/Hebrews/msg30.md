whenever we have a handicap or are unable to go on we need to cross a river.

> once you have been stirred up to go on with the Lord, you do not need that much repentance. repentance has been overemphasized in today's revivalistic Christianity. nearly every revivalist has learned one skill--to stir people up to repentance. but now I must tell you that you do not need to repent that much. the Lord is bored with your repentance. in a sense, the Lord is disgusted with so many repenting prayers. he wants to see you going on, not repenting of the same thing over and over again. to go on simply means to cross the river, to go from one side to another, from one stage to another. do not talk or consider. go on. leave your old concepts, understandings, doctrines and teachings, and go on. the faster you go on, the better.

thr earth can never be burned, but what grows on it can be. likewise we will not be burned but what we bring forth that is not according to gods economy will be.

'fled for refuge' - an intensified fleeing, to flee intensely.

'an anchor of the soul', 'where the forerunner, Jesus, has entered for us', 'within the veil' - the holy of holies, where God is, within the veil, is our safe place, our refuge, the anchor for our soul the lord Jesus is the forerunner, who took the lead to flee all other things and enter into this safe refuge. now it's up to us to do the same.
