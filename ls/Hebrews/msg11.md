history of the doctrine of sanctification. methodists had the concept of sinless
perfection. they had many methods to try to sanctify themselves. then the brethren
showed by the bible that this is not sanctification but human effort. according to
the brethren sanctification is positional. the gold in the temple or the offering on
the altar were holy because of their position. but sanctification is not only positional
but also dispositions. it involves a change in our nature.

(v2:11) for which cause he is not ashamed to call us brothers. the which cause is that
both christ the sanctified and we who are being sanctified are of one source. because
we have the same source he can call us brothers. we wouldn't call a dog our brother
no matter how much we like it. so this is a matter of disposition.
