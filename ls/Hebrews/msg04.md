hebrews presents a comparison between judaism and christ. judaism was given by God,
it was not heathen. hence the Hebrews found it hard to let go. but the chief priest
persecuted them and told them to "get out". God did not come to rebuke them. he came
to give them a comparison. rebuking does not help, but making a comparison between black
and white does. then we can make a proper choice.

the boasts of judaism:
- the true God
- the angels
- Moses, who brought God to man, and wrote the pentetuch
- the priesthood, which brought man to God
- the covenant

the comparison:
- the Jewish God is a hidden God, our God is a revealed God his salvation and in his Son.

the son is a divine gift from God to us, and he is God himself reaching us and being given to us.

compared to angels:
- having a more excellent name, that of a Son (1:4)
- designated the Son in resurrection (1:5)
- seated at the right hand in ascension (1:13)
- worshipped by the angels in his second coming (1:6)
- as God inheriting the throne of God's kingdom (1:8)
- being everlasting in eternity (1:10-12)
