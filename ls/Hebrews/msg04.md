hebrews presents a comparison between judaism and christ. judaism was given by God,
it was not heathen. hence the Hebrews found it hard to let go. but the chief priest
persecuted them and told them to "get out". God did not come to rebuke them. he came
to give them a comparison. rebuking does not help, but making a comparison between black
and white does. then we can make a proper choice.
