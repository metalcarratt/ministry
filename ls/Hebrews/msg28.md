in ascension christ "stripped off" the rulers and authorities. in greek the word means to
dust off as with a feather duster. christ ascended above the attraction of the earth,
the demons, the principalities and powers. we need to enjoy such a christ.

when melchizedek came to Abraham the father of the called race, he ministered to him bread and wine. before the Lord went to death he also ministered bread and wine to his disciples. we may not appreciate every lords day that the one ministering to us the bread and wine is according to the order of this melchizedek.
