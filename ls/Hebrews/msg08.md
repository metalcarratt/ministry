in one ch of heb 2 is revealed: incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, glorification,
and exaltation. furthermore, the way these are revealed is not shallow, but deep,
"philosophical" and "peculiar"

## incarnation
- (2:14) rather than just saying he became a man to die for our sins, heb 2 says he partook
of blood and flesh that he might share in the same as the children (2:14). he
incarnated to become one with us, with our race. he came as a man on our level.

- (2:17) he also came on the same level as us to sympathize with us.

## death
- (2:9) tasted death on behalf of everything. this includes the animals. by tasting death for everything he has reconciled everything to himself. also by this, death has been abolished.
- (2:17) propitiation for sins. appeasing.
- (2:14) destroyed (brought to none effect) the devil
- (2:15) released from slavery and the fear of death

## resurrection
- (2:11) bringing us forth as his many brothers.
- (2:12) declaring the father to us. this means to bring us the father as the source that we might become partakers of the divine nature.
- (2:12) praising the fathers name in the church, establishing the first church meeting of the brothers all together.
