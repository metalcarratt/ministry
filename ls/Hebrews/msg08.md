in one ch of heb 2 is revealed: incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, glorification,
and exaltation. furthermore, the way these are revealed is not shallow, but deep,
"philosophical" and "peculiar"

## incarnation
rather than just saying he became a man to die for our sins, heb 2 says he partook
of blood and flesh that he might share in the same as the children (2:14). he
incarnated to become one with us, with our race. he came as a man on our level.

he also came on the same level as us to sympathize with us.
