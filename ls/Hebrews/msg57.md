within the veil and outside the camp.

first we enter within the veil and then we go outside the camp this is the opposite
to our natural understanding. enter the veil motivates us to leave the camp. the
more we enter the veil the less we will be in religion.

religion is in our blood. when the serpent deceived eve the first thing he did was
to talk about God. then he told her she could know good and evil. that is religion.

to go unto Jesus outside the camp is the pathway of the cross.

whenever we are in our divisive or religious soul we are "camping". the more we enter within the veil the more we will begin to hate our camping religious self.
