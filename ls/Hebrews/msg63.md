> How can pride be humble? I am a dog. how can a dog be a bird? it is impossible. our eyes must be opened to see that we can never be humble and that real humility is in christ. we should simply submit ourselves to Him and say, "Lord, You do it. it is no longer I, but Christ  who lived in and out of me." if you simply submit to christ, he will live himself out of you, and you will becomethe expression and testimony of God. this is God's economy.
