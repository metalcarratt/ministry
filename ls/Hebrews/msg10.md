glory is the expression of god. in the new jerusalem God is on the throne at the center
shining as light. that light is not a natural light such as the sun or a man made light
like a lamp but is the glory of God. the lamb is the lamp and the walls are made of
Jasper. Jasper is the appearance of god. so this glory shines from the center to the whole
city.

the children of israel had gods glory as they wandered in the wilderness. that was
the pillar of cloud and the pillar of fire that was gods visible expression and lead them the whole time. the goal of crossing the river was to build the temple as gods habitation, and when it was built it was filled with glory. however that is only a type and the real temple was the children of israel themselves. thus the glory filling the temple was a sign that God had filled his people.

the crossing of the river brings us into the glory. Abraham was brought out of the land of idolatry, the red sea brought the children of israel out of the world and the Jordan brought them out of themselves. every time the priest went into the temple he had to wash at the laver, a standing river. this is the same for us when we come before God. eventually we all need to pass the river of glass, the lake of fire before gods throne to enter his glory.
