glory is the expression of god. in the new jerusalem God is on the throne at the center
shining as light. that light is not a natural light such as the sun or a man made light
like a lamp but is the glory of God. the lamb is the lamp and the walls are made of
Jasper. Jasper is the appearance of god. so this glory shines from the center to the whole
city.
