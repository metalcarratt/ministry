in the old testament were the law and the prophets. the law never changed. however the
word of the prophet could change. on one day God could command through the prophet one
thing and on the next day commanda different thing. in the new Testament today we have
the law of life and the anointing. the law of life is based on God's nature, and thus
does not change. if the law of life does not allow us to do something it will not allow
it tomorrow either. but the anointing changes. one day he may lead us one way and another
day another way. he may lead one brother one way and another brother another way.
