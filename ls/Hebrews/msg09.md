Christ is the captain of our salvation, bringing us into glory. glory is not just
an outward shining. it is the final expression of the growth in life, just like the
blossoming of a carnation seed is the final step of its growth. for the seed to become
a flower it must fight. it has to fight the shell and then the soil. so this growth
is a kind of fighting. the children of israel also fought from Jericho until David
built the temple. finally gods glory filled the temple. this glory didn't come from.
without. it came from the children of israel who had passed through the process by
fighting. the Lord also fought his whole life. eventually he was glorified in resurrection. since he fought he is qualified to be our captain, leading us on the pathway to the same glory.

christ suffered to leave a pattern for us to follow in his steps. he was "perfected" meaning he became qualified by experiencing human suffering. he can be our captain leading us on because he has experienced the suffering before us.
