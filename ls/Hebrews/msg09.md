Christ is the captain of our salvation, bringing us into glory. glory is not just
an outward shining. it is the final expression of the growth in life, just like the
blossoming of a carnation seed is the final step of its growth. for the seed to become
a flower it must fight. it has to fight the shell and then the soil. so this growth
is a kind of fighting. the children of israel also fought from Jericho until David
built the temple. finally gods glory filled the temple. this glory didn't come from.
without. it came from the children of israel who had passed through the process by
fighting.
