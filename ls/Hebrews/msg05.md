as gods son, christ is his heir. he was appointed by the father (v2) and anointed with
the spirit (v9) and in resurrection designated the Son of God and begotten as the firstborn
son. then he was inaugurated in ascension. he has inherited all gods riches as the creator
of this universe.

we are joint heirs. to be an heir, first one needs to be born as a son. second one needs
to grow to maturity, and third one needs to be legally appointed. we have been born of God
and made hiers of God, joint heirs with christ. we will share the lords throne and
with him inherit all things.
