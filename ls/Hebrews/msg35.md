only two verses in the bible talk about christ interceeding for us, and neither of them
are about redemption. in rom. 8:34 christ is interceeding for our glorification, and in
hebrews 7:24 he is interceeding for us to be saved to the uttermost. these are the
same thing.

> chedorlaomer, who was slaughtered by Abraham, does not represent sin but the by-products of death. when Abraham learned that lot had been captured, that capture was a matter of the by-products of death. all the elders in the churches must be slaughtering elders. when the elders come into the meetings and see that many of the dear brothers have been captured by chedorlaomer, they must slaughter that king. do not rebuke or condemn the brothers who had been captured but slaughter chedorlaomer, the by-products of death, that have captured the brothers and sisters and hold them in bondage. if you do this our melchizedek will come in, and you will enjoy his ministry.
