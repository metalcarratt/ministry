we are partners with Christ (3:14). God has a great enterprise, which is His
corporate expression. Christ as the apostle has been anointed by God, inaugurated into
the office of heading up this enterprise. as His Body we have been anointed also. now
we are his partners, working with him to gain this glorious expression. as we preach
the high gospel we should have the sense that we are partners with christ.
