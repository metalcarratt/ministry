we are partners with Christ (3:14). God has a great enterprise, which is His
corporate expression. Christ as the apostle has been anointed by God, inaugurated into
the office of heading up this enterprise. as His Body we have been anointed also. now
we are his partners, working with him to gain this glorious expression. as we preach
the high gospel we should have the sense that we are partners with christ.

we need to understand the trinity according to the word and experience, not our limited human mentality and understanding. the son is the father and the son is the spirit.

> God wanted this unique heir to enter into the good land of the glorious expression ofthe divine being with a group of joint heirs.

this expression is glorious because it is corporate. two million went into the good land with Joshua. as partakers, God is the Holy Spirit. as partners God is Jesus christ to us.
