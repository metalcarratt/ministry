the basic concept in the bible regarding our worship of God is eating. we must pay our
full attention to it. don't try to learn many things but continue to eat in the presence
of the Lord.

the hidden manna is the deepest experience in the tabernacle, behind four layers: the tabernacle, the veil, the ark, the pot. the kernel among kernels is the hidden manna.

manna has the following properties:
- comes with the dew, as grace in a soft watering fashion
- small yet immeasurable
- round, eternal
- like frost, able to kill the negative things
- white, cleansed and purified
- eaten in many ways, as cakes, bread, wafers
- like a coriander seed, tiny but bringing life
- tasting like honey (vegetable+animal life, sweet)
- tasting like fresh oil (spirit)
- appearance of bdellium. looking like an eye. four living creatures full of eyes. eyes make us transparent.
- not legal (how we enjoy it)
