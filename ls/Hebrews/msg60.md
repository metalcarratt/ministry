in order to enjoy the hidden manna we must be so close to God. only those in the wilderness
with the children of israel could enjoy the open manna, and only those who had right to
the outer court could eat the sacrifices. only those in the holy place could eat the bread
from the shwobread table. only those at the feasts could enjoy the portion brought there.
in the same way, only the high priest in the holy of holies could enjoy the hidden manna.
in rev it was the overcomers in the church in pergamos who could eat the hidden manna.
how close we are to God dictates what portion of him we can enjoy as our food.

those is Christianity can enjoy the open manna. when we are enjoying the world or arguing with our wife we may experience the lords rebuking. this is also open manna. but to enjoy the hidden manna we have to be separated from all things other than God. in theholy of holies there is no outward work to do. we can only minister to the lord. there may be much persecution outwardly, but we enjoy a hidden supply of the Lord.

> the levites served in the outer court, and the priests served in the outer court and the holy place where they arranged the showbread, trimmed the lamp, and burned the incense. but when the high priest entered into the holy of holies, there was hardly any work to do. here in the holy of holies the high priest ministered directly in the presence of God. here, in the holy of holies, the ministering one enjoys the hidden manna.

question: what does it mean here to minister directly in the presence of God?
