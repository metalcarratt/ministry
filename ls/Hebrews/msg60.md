in order to enjoy the hidden manna we must be so close to God. only those in the wilderness
with the children of israel could enjoy the open manna, and only those who had right to
the outer court could eat the sacrifices. only those in the holy place could eat the bread
from the shwobread table. only those at the feasts could enjoy the portion brought there.
in the same way, only the high priest in the holy of holies could enjoy the hidden manna.
in rev it was the overcomers in the church in pergamos who could eat the hidden manna.
how close we are to God dictates what portion of him we can enjoy as our food.
