whether we will enjoy the sabbath during the kingdom will depend on our exercise in
this age. we need to ripen, mature, and use the talent given to us. both growth and
talent are something of grace, not of ourselves, but requires us to open and allow the
Lord to work.

talent in Matthew is the same as gift in the epistles. the reason there is no proper
order today is the world lacks the proper rulers. but who will rule in the millennium
if we have not been disciplined in this age?

the calvinist view that there will be no problem in the future is an escape. we need to take these portions of the word seriously.
