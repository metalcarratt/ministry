our sabbath rest is a growing sabbath. the lord has come as the seed and has
sown himself into some of humanity as the soil. how much we enjoy the sabbath
rest will depend on how much this seed grow within us. in order to fully enter
the sabbath rest we need to mature and to mature we need to be in the church life.
