the fourth warning in hebrews 10:26 talks about not sinning wilfully or there will not
remain a sacrifice for sin. the meaning here is that the believers should not shrink
back to judaism by abandoning their assembling together but meet in all the meetings of
the church. if they shrank back to judaism the sacrifice for sin there would no longer
remain for christ has already come. it does not mean that if we commit sin we will not
be forgiven anymore.
