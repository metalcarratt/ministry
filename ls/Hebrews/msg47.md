> in these messages we have said a great deal about gods economy. if we shut our eyes of faith, there will be nothing, and everything we have said will be in vain. but if we exercise our faith, we shall see how much there is in God's economy. if wehave no faith everything is gone. but if we have faith, there is great wealth before us.

we must have faith to reject the worldy pleasures and believe in a glorious future.

to not believe is to have an evil heart of unbelief. nothing insults God more than unbelief.

#### faith

"substantiating of things hoped for." just like a physical book is substantiated by our sense of touch, so faith is the sense that substantiates things we cannot see. it is like a sixth sense.

the bible is full of bequests. if we have faith we can substantiate them. to unbelievers the bible is just a hard to understand book but to us it us full of promises we can realise by faith.

we are aiming at the holy of holies and the new jerusalem, both things of faith.

faith is God himself. we need more of his transfusing.
