> in these messages we have said a great deal about gods economy. if we shut our eyes of faith, there will be nothing, and everything we have said will be in vain. but if we exercise our faith, we shall see how much there is in God's economy. if wehave no faith everything is gone. but if we have faith, there is great wealth before us.

we must have faith to reject the worldy pleasures and believe in a glorious future.

to not believe is to have an evil heart of unbelief. nothing insults God more than unbelief.
