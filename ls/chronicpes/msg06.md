Kings of Judah

We need to be careful in all the details,
even the small ones.

Some things they did wrong:
- caring for their own kingdom
- indulgence in sexual lust by having many wives and concubines
- helping the king of Israel
- not trusting in God for sickness and in war

Some good things:
- standing on the proper ground and declaring it before the enemy
- fasting to pray before the battle and going out trusting in God with the singers
