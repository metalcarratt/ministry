Recovery of truth:
- assurance of salvation
- New Jerusalem
- God becoming man that man become God
This truth revealed in Catholic books.

Our practice is also important. We need to
walk according to the spirir in everything.
Our "law" today is just the spirit. Some
kings were relatively good but made mistakes
in smaller details. They were still punished
by God for this.
