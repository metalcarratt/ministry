The kings of Judah had the proper ground
and the fundamental faith, however this was
not enough. As kings they were positioned to
enjoy the good land to the fullest, but how
much they enjoyed the good land depended on
who they were, how they behaved themselves
and what they goals, intentions amd interests
were.

In the church life we can behave well in the
meetings but how do we behave at home? We
may be a scorpion in our interacting with our
wife or husband. Most vital groups are dead
and lifeless because the members do not have
the proper living and expression in their
daily life.
