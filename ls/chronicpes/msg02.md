God has a hobby which is to become man.
He is very patient and takes a long
time to do things.

We are God in life and in nature but we do
not live this habitually. We may start the
day as god, then become a scorpion by the
middle of the day and end up as Satan at the
end of the day. This shows we need transformation.

Because the teaching in Christianity does not
include the high peak of the divine revelation
it has become stale and many Christians and
even leaders have no goal.
