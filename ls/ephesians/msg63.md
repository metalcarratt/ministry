Three wills - God's, Satan's and man's.

New man needs grace and truth, bride needs love and light, warrior needs power and armour.

Sit, walk, stand. Sit to enjoy the blessings, walk to work for God, stand against the enemy

Power, armour.
Armour is corporate. Against strategems of Satan. Not against blood and flesh.
