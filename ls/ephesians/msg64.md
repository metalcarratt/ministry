Girdle of truth - strengthening put whole being. Truth is Christ expressed, experienced, lived out as a pattern in our daily living. When we live Christ as truth our whole being is strong to stand against the enemy.

Breastplate of righteousness - protecting the conscience. The blood of Christ protects out conscience and Christ Himself is our righteousness. If we have offence we have holes in our conscience that allows faith to leak out. By the blood we cover our conscience and protect it from the accusations of the devil.

Shod feet with gospel of peace - gospel of peace is peace between God and man and between Jews and Gentiles. When we are at peace with God and the saints, we are strengthened to stand for the spiritual battle.

These three things enable us to stand and standing is the most important thing in warfare. Our battle is like wrestling that needs a firm footing.
