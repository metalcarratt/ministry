Gospel includes breaking down of ordinances becaause through this the church can be produced and the church as the one new man is the final part of the gospel.
Christ abilished ordinances to create one new man, making jews close to gentiles and gentiles close to jews to become one.

The old man, together with ordinances and doctrine are vs the church life.
Put off the old man, the former manner of life.

The new man is the practical church life.

Not grieving the holy spirit:
"Not caring for the church life is one of the main ways we grieve the Spirit. For example, if you do not attend the meetings of the church, you may grieve the Spirit. Many grieve the Spirit by refusing to function in the meetings. Often they have the sense in their spirit to speak or to call on the name of the Lord, but they refuse to do so. At such times they grieve the Holy Spirit of God. Furthermore, we may grieve the Spirit in many ways in our daily life. Our daily living should be part of the new man, part of the church life. We are not to pretend that we are humble or well-behaved, but to put on the church life in a practical way. How marvelous it would be if day by day we all experienced Christ as the all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit mingling Himself with our spirit in a corporate way!"

The washing in the word is for cleansing the spots and wrinkles - our oldness and wounds.
"In the church life it is necessary to have frequent contact with one another. However, the more we contact one another, the more we hurt one another. If a brother would stay with me for several days, no doubt he would be hurt by me, and I would be hurt by him. The only way to remove the spots caused by this mutual wounding is to experience the washing of the water in the Word. If you are not cleansed of your wounds by the water in the Word, you may be offended and discouraged and even consider giving up the church life."
