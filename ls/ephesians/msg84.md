We should not be dumb worshippers. Our God is a speaking God and His worshippers must be a speaking people.

To prophecy is primarily to speak for God and speak forth God.

If we want to be scriptural  we should not be dumb worshippers but should prophecy according to the Biblical meaning of prophecy.
