God's purpose today is to build the church. Many christians do not believe the Lord is building the church today because they are in division and cannot be built up.

Seven aspects of the church: new man, kingdom, family, body, bride, warrior, dwelling place of God.

As such we need to take Christ as our life, and person, love, family, rule, dwelling place in spirit, enemy afraid of us as the Body.
