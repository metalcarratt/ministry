Parts of the Word we cannot understand
in our natural life:
- near in the blood of Christ
- gospel of peace
- one new man
All these terms refer to our relationship
with one another.

Need to deal with all ordinances. If some
church takes the right ground but practices
pentecostal things we still need to accept
them as the church. Otherwise we have 
returned to ordinances.
