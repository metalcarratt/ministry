- the church-loving Christ
- the new-man-creating Christ
- the all-things-heading-up Christ
- the gift-making and gift-giving Christ
- the home-making Christ

The lord is focusing on building His church today. Some in christianity think this is not possible but it is and is a shame to the enemy. The Lord will gain churches in Rome and Jerusalem.
The Lord came to China as virgin soil to incubate the church life but went to the US to propoagte to the world.

He is making us gifts. We may not feel capable but He is making us gifta to the church by His ascending and descending.
