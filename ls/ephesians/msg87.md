Christ abolished ordinances on the cross. Other things are obviously in need of the cross, but we may not realise we need the cross to deal with ordinances. Dealing with sin or the natural man is for ourselves but dealing with ordinances is for the Lord because it prevents the building up of the one new man.
Christ is our only foundation but many groups seem to use an ordinance as their foundation. We should not insist on any ordinance, not even somrthing like pray reading or calling on the name of the Lord.

Only four things idolatroy, immorality, divisivnes, denial of diety, are things we can separate from someone because of.

If we only hold to christ he will be the corner stone to join us together.

Churches cannot be independent. Whenever an arm receives an injection, that is for the whole body.

Whenever we need to consider a practical matter, what we need is to contact the Lord, not hold to an ordinance.
