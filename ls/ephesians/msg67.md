Tychicus was the one who enabled fellowship between the apostle and the churches. We need fellowship among the churches. We need to visit the churches.

Faith, love, peace, grace.

Result of grace is peace. But peace ia first here, so after enjoying peace we need more grace.

Love with faith. Love is from God, faith is from us. If our faith is weak its hard to love the Lord.
