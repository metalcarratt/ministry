Christ wants to eat us up to make us glorious.

His goal with us is not that we would be good,
kind, spiritual or victorious only, but
that we would be glorious. He wants to
present to Himself a glorious bride.

We become glorious by allowing Him to eat us 
up, to consumer every part of our being and replace
it with Himself.

Need to be saturated by him and he needs to be expanded from inside to outside, not from heaven to earth (outward). The glorious church will come out of 
us. So we need to keep eating the Lord and let Him eat us up, consume our whole being.
