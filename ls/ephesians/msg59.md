The church must be glorious, rather than victorious,
Spiritual or heavenly.

He wants us to be glorious. We need to have the righr focus.

He wants to shine out from within us by shining Himself into us.

When we are in situations our goal should not be to be vicrorious but to be glorious by being in his presence.

We can be victorious not glorious. Maybe one day we can overcome out temper but that is not glorious.

We need to have the face of Jesus.
