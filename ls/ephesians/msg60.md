Need to focus on eating not table manners.
We need to take Christ as our Person.
Don't try to focus on teaching and doctrines.

Steal saturated with fire losses its natural colour and glows. But if you take the steal out of the fire it looses the glow. The glow is by staying on the fire. We need to enjoy the glory and shining of God, not focus on behaviour.
