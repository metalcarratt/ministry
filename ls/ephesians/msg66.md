Prayer is the way to apply the six items of the armour.

In prayer our mind should not be overactive and our emotion should be regulated. Also our will must be strong.

Out time must be scheduled and controlled.

Do not allow distractions.

Prayer for:
- our prayer life
- all the saints
- the high gospel
- to speak boldly, as an ambassador.
