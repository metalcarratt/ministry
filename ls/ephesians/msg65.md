Sheid of faith

We must have faith in:
- God's heart (always good)
- God's faithfulness (never change)
- God's ability (able)
- God's word (promise)
- God's will (always positive)
- God's sovereignty (no regret)

Satan's attacks are:
- tempations
- proposals
- doubts
- questions
- lies
- attacks
Don't need to confess thoughts that come from him but reject them.
