## ordiances
For the new man we need to drop all ordinance.

An ordinance is something based on a law that we insist on. To drop all ordinances is to have bo feeling toward them. For example, if we are bothered by speaking in tongues it shows we have an ordinance against speaking in tongues. We need not ordinances but the Spirit.

Replacea the spirit, causes division

## doctrines
Do not accept even the best doctrine if it distracts you from Christ and the church. It is the Spirit, not doctrine, that produces the church. 

The word is for nourishment not for doctrines.

Ordinances are a wall and doctrines are a wind. Ordiances prevent us from being built up and doctrines can carry us away.
