For the new man we need to drop all ordinance.

An ordinance is something based on a law that we insist on. To drop all ordinances is to have bo feeling toward them. For example, if we are bothered by speaking in tongues it shows we have an ordinance against speaking in tongues. We need not ordinances but the Spirit.
