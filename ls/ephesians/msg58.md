Sanctify, cleanse, cherish, nourish

Outward change, behaviour is not sanctification. It is religion.
Only by coming to the Lord can we be sanctified.
As we come to Him He not only santifies bit cleanses.
Cleansing is to remove the old disposition.
Nourishment and cherishing is necessary so that we do not find the cleansing painful.
