Sanctify, cleanse, cherish, nourish

Outward change, behaviour is not sanctification. It is religion.
Only by coming to the Lord can we be sanctified.
As we come to Him He not only santifies bit cleanses.
Cleansing is to remove the old disposition.
Nourishment and cherishing is necessary so that we do not find the cleansing painful.

He sanctifies you by adding himself into us. He cleanses us with his nourishment to subtract our old disposition and cherishes us with his warmth.
Through that he is preparing us to be his bride. Whenever we try to do or be good without christ it is religion. So we need to gain christ.
