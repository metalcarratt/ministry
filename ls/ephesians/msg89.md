Doctrines come from ordinances and ordinances are based on doctrines.

The need today is the growth in life. Doctrine is like a bait which Satan uses to hook us. Doctrines result in division.

We shouldn't care fot doctrine but for enjoying Christ and ministering the "processed" Christ - the Christ enjoyed and experienced by us
