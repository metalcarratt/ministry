God takes care of His people in a hidden way. He prepared many things in advance
to save His people in a hidden way, such as: setting up a king over the most powerful
kingdom, causing the king to depose his wife, raising up Esther to become the
King's wife.

Br. Lee had a similar experience during ww2 when he was captured by some soldiers 
loyal to the Japanese. The wife of the captain of the army was someone he knew
and she convinced her husband to release them.
