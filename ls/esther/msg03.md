three kinds of churches: catholic, protestant and original and recovered.

catholic church has appearance of god (gold) but is full of idols. its end is to
be burned with fire.

protestant church is full of flase believers who will also be cast into to fire.

original and recovered church will be judged by what kind of work they built with.e who 
those who build with wood, grass, stubble will have their work burned and be
disciplined by the Lord for a thousand years.

those who build with gold, silver and precious stone will enter into the nj during the millennium as a reward.
