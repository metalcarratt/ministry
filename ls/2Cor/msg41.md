three groups: "through"
- weapons to fight for gods kingdom
- glory and dishonor
- evil and good report

seven kinds of person: "as"
- deceiver yet true
- unknown yet well known
- dying yet living
- disciplined but not put to death
- sorrowful yet rejoicing
- poor yet enriching
- having nothing yet possessing all

the negative things are how others saw the apostles. for example evil report, deceiver,
etc. all true ministers will be spoken ill of by others. but the inward reality will
be different.

Paul emplores the believers to have an enlarged heart like his. he speaks as to children,
showing that these qualifications are related to the growth and maturity in life.
