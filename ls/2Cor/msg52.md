paul had to deal with the judaisers coming to Corinth, a church he raised up, and
causing problems, different teachings, rebellions. this shows that the situation
at that time was the same in principle as today. there are many that oppose the lords
recovery, speaking things against us.

the judaisers do not minister life or bring others to christ. instead they hold on to their traditions. they had the traditions of Moses which they could not let go of. since Paul was against circumcision they went against Paul. the principle is the same today. the judaisers stir up questions but the ministry stirs up our love for the lord.

the ministry stirs up our love for the lord as virgins. the lord is our bridegroom, our husband and we need to focus on him. don't let anything replace him in our lives.
