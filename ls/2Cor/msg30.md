the ministers and the ministry become one. in 3:8 paul says the ministry of the spirit
is in glory and in 3:9 that the ministry of righteousness abounds in glory. this is
two stages of the ministry. first we get the spirit, which brings glory into us,
then we live out righteousness, which causes glory to abound in us.

in 3:18 pauls says "we" are being transformed into the same image of glory, from glory to glory,
even as from the lord spirit. this shows that we are becoming the ministry. the ministry is
of glory and we are becoming glory.

ch4 proves that the the ministers and the ministry are one. they live and work out what they
are. their working is their living.

the glory of the old covenant was physical but fading. the glory of the new covenant is abounding
but invisible. it is sensed rather than seen, throught living of those who have it.

4:6 God created the old creation through the shining of physical light. the new creation
comes through him shining into our hearts. thus this glory gets into our hearts to become us.

4:7 we have the treasure in earthen vessels. the glory shined into us is a precious treasure,
which is the ministry. this treasure enables us to live a crucified and resurrected life to manifest christ.
