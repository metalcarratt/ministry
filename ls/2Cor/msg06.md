when Paul ministered he wrote a letter of christ into the believers heart with
the ink of the spirit of God. at the same time as the letter was being written
in their heart the same letter was being written in his heart. this shows that
the ministry binds the minister and the ministee together. it also show that
ministry cannot be something light or simple. it is like giving birth or growing
a flower. it cannot be mass produced but requires time and care.
