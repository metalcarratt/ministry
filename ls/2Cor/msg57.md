paul lists many negative things, such as whispherings, slanders, puffed up and gross sins. we shouldn't think these things can't creep into the church life.

christ became weak to be crucified to redeem us of our sins. now that he has accomplished redemption he is no longer in weakness. Paul became weak to the Corinthians that he might preach the gospel to them and build them up. he was weak in christ. this means he lived a crucified life to be weak so that he could shepherd others.

paul seemed to be indicating himself but actually he was building the believers up. this is because if they were separated from the apostle it would affect their relationship with the Lord. thus to be fully reconciled, their relationship with the apostle also had to be made proper.

the biblical concept of an apostle and an elder is not that of a position of ruling over others, but of someone being sent by God to others, in order to minister christ to them, to help them to grow, and to be built up in the body of christ. in this sense, regardless of our age, we should all qualified to be "apostles".
