paul lists many negative things, such as whispherings, slanders, puffed up and gross sins. we shouldn't think these things can't creep into the church life.

christ became weak to be crucified to redeem us of our sins. now that he has accomplished redemption he is no longer in weakness. Paul became weak to the Corinthians that he might preach the gospel to them and build them up. he was weak in christ. this means he lived a crucified life to be weak so that he could shepherd others.
