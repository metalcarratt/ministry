in ch 4 Paul talks about his life, not his work. his life was hi ministry.

the gospels are also a focus primarily on the lords life, not work. even when work is mentioned,
such as when the lord fed 5000, it says he withdrew to pray. again when the people welcomed
him into the city he said he was a grain of wheat falling to the earth to die.

in ch 4 Paul repeatedly refers to the name Jesus. this is the name of a little man from Nazareth.
