rejoice - to vocalise our inner joy

be perfected - active passive. the lord is the medicine, paul was the doctor, but we need
to be willing to take the medicine.

think the same thing - tuning a piano requires all keys to be tuned to be in harmony with the other keys. not have "peculiar thoughts"

end with a blessing: the love of God, grace of christ, fellowship of the holy spirit. this verse proves grace is something *of* christ, that is the triune god as our enjoyment.
