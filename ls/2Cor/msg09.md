the apostles did not merely preach the gospel,
they shined forth the glory of christ.
to shine requires not speaking or doctrine
but a certain kind of living. our living
needs to be a reflection (as a luminary) of
the living god of glory as the gospel (as the
sun). 

their conduct:
1. "having this ministry". the ministry is singular and all the apostles carry out the one unique ministry.
2. not losing heart
3. renounced the hidden things of shame
4. not adulterating the word of god - adulterate means to mix something in to gold or wine to artificialy increase its value. some add things to the word of god to make their speaking more interesting
5. manifesting the truth by living out christ

spiritual photography - the veil needs to be removed before the light of the gospel can shine into others.
