egypt, wilderness and canaan typify body, soul and spirit, which also typify outer court, holy place and holy of holiest.

christs death for our sins reconciled us to God, bringing us from the outer court to the holy place, to our soul.
christs death for us, as persons, reconciles us to God, bringing us from the holy place to the holy of holiest, which is our spirit.
both sections have a veil. the second veil is the flesh.

the apostles had been reconciled to God to the highest extent, being in the holy of holiest, thus even though the believers and been redeemed they still had a ministry of reconciliation to bring the believers on from the holy place to the holy of holiest, from wandering in the mind to the spirit.
we can only bring people on to where we are. if we are in the outer court we can bring people to the outer court. if we are in the holy place or the holy of holiest we can bring people there.

the final result of being reconciled to God in the holy of holiest is to become the righteousness of God. through the fall we became sin.
through God's reconciliation we become the righteousness of God.
