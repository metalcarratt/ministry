paul uses two pictures to describe the rapture and glorification of our body: a building and clothing.

our fallen body is described as an earthly tabernacle, while our glorified body is described as a house in the heavens. the tabernacle will eventually be taken down but the house is solid with a foundation.
the tabernacle is not only a place to live but also a place to worship.

being unclothed is a picture of death, whereas being clothed upon is a picture of being glorified
in our body. some say we go to heaven when we die but God would not allow us to appear before
him naked. to appear before God we must be clothed upon.

thr apostles groaned to be clothed upon. the younger ones may have a desire to continue
living in this would but as we get older we have a greater desire to be captured. one of the
characteristics of a minister of the new covenant is this desire to be clothed upon.
