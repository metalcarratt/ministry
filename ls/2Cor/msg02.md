### 2 Cor. 1:12-14

key word is 'singleness' in v12. in proceeding vv paul said they were in a death situation.
human beings can handle almost any situation but not death. the apostles could
only handle it because they had the resurrection life. this forced them to be single,
simple, about how they handled it. worldly people can use many
crafty means to get out of a situation, but the apostles were forced into a situation
where they had no choice but to rely on the lord simply and singularity.

pauls conscience testified that the way he dealt with the situation was pure, not 
in knowledge, ability, strength or wisdom, not in politics.

Paul mentioned this to the Corinthians because they were not simple. complicated people complicate the church life. it is better not to argue or correct such a
person or you also will get trapped in complications.

Jesus was wise but also single like this. so is God. if God were not single, if he measured us every time we came to him we would not be able to stand it. for this reason, a single person is also generous. they do not analyse in complexity before deciding to do something for someone else.
