### 2 Cor. 1:12-14

key word is 'singleness' in v12. in proceeding vv paul said they were in a death situation.
human beings can handle almost any situation but not death. the apostles could
only handle it because they had the resurrection life. this forced them to be single,
simple, about how they handled it. worldly people can use many
crafty means to get out of a situation, but the apostles were forced into a situation
where they had no choice but to rely on the lord simply and singularity.
