11:3 paul likens judaisers work to satan deceiving eve. the tree of life is simple but the
tree of knowledge is complicated.

God's goal is life and Satan's goal is to turn us from life issuing in death. death is just the separation from the enjoyment of god.

the secret of real discernment is to discern someone's speaking by whether or not their speaking brings us into the enjoyment of God. any teaching that causes your enjoyment of the Lord to cease is something of death.
