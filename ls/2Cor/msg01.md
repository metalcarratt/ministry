first 1.5 ch of 2 cor is an intro. 2 reasons so long: Paul needed time to "bind up the
wounds" cause by his first epistle. first section all about comfort.
2nd, Paul was an emotional person, as reflected in
his somewhat repetitous way of speaking.

only those who have been through affliction and have been comforted can comfort others.

1 cor deals with gifts, 2 cor deals with the ministry. ministry replaces gifts.

in the apostles suffering they were brought to the point they had no confidence in themselves. to have no confidence in themselves mean they could not longer live in themselves but in resurrection.
