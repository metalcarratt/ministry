there is one ministry but also many ministries. the many ministries are the different
services the saints engage in, but each of these ministries is to carry out the work of
the unique ministry.

the unique ministry inscribed christ into people. thus everything we do in our personal
ministry must also be to inscribe christ into people.

the essence that is inscribed into us is the processed triune god. at the end of the bible
it says "the spirit and the bride say come." this is the greatest expression in the
human language, since it describesboth God and the tripartite man in their ultimate states.
