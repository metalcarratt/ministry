the glory of the ministry of the new
covenant much greater than that of the
old covenant. the old covenant came with
glory, but the new covenant is in glory.
the glory of the old covenant shined on
one mans face (moses), but the glory of
the new covenant shines out from millions
of believers. instead of coming to visit
us this glory comes to invade, pervade,
permeate, soak, and saturate us. it first
comes to saturate us as then shines out
from within us.
