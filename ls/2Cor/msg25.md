the spirit is the _essence_ of the new covenant ministry. as such an essence it is not something only of power, or an instrument, the doer:
- pauls metaphor of writing letters makes the spirit as the ink, the essence of what is being written on the tablets
- Paul contrasts the ministry of death with the ministry of the spirit. normally life is in opposition to death, showing this spirit is the embodiment of life.
- from glory to glory even as from the lord spirit - also an essence
