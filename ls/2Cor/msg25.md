the spirit is the _essence_ of the new covenant ministry. as such an essence it is not something only of power, or an instrument:
- pauls metaphor of writing letters makes the spirit as the ink, the essence of what is being written on the tablets. not merely the writer, instrument or power, or even person.
- Paul contrasts the ministry of death with the ministry of the spirit. normally life is in opposition to death, showing this spirit is the embodiment of life.
- from glory to glory even as from the lord spirit - also an essence

the new covenant ministry is of the spirit and righteousness. the spirit is the inward essence and righteousness is the outward expression. both are God Himself.
