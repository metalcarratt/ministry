2 cor 6:1-13 describes an all fitting life. for example v5 says "in stripes, in imprisonment, in tumultuous..."

v1 Paul says he works together with God. at the end of ch5 he says he has been given the ministry of reconciliation. so this work is to reconcile the believers back to God.

reconciliation is not just to be brought back to God judicially, but to be brought back into God, to being one with god, which means that he lives in us and we live in him.

the apostles worked with god to do a work of reconciliation. we may like to work for god but not with god. this is like a wife liking to cook for her husband but not with him (asking him to go out of the kitchen). to work with god we must be one with him, being reconciled ourselves.

pauls entreaty was to "not receive the grace of God in vain". to not be one with god in any matter is to receive the grace of God in vain. thus this is the word of reconciliation.
