2 cor 6:1-13 describes an all fitting life. for example v5 says "in stripes, in imprisonment, in tumultuous..."

v1 Paul says he works together with God. at the end of ch5 he says he has been given the ministry of reconciliation. so this work is to reconcile the believers back to God.

reconciliation is not just to be brought back to God judicially, but to be brought back into God, to being one with god, which means that he lives in us and we live in him.
