as christians we need to live by faith and walk by faith, not by sight.
a believer takes things unseen, confesses them and realises them by faith.
do not believe in your feelings, believe in the facts.

the daily killing is to release the divine life in resurrection. the afflcition, perplexion (unable to find a way out), persecution, being cast down, are all for this.

eventually this life is for others.
