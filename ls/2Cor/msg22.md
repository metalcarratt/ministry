glory is god expressed. when the lord was on the earth his glory was concealed but
when he passed through death and entered resurrection he entered glory. in resurrection
he became the spirit, thus glory is the resurrected christ as the spirit.

for us to shine forth the glory of the new covenant we need to live the resurrected christ
as the spirit. others should be able to see the shining from within us.
