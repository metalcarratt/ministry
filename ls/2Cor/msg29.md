if we walk according to the spirit we shall automatically fulfill the law.
for example, if we walk according to the spirit we shall never take another
another God and we would never worship an idol. we would not take the lords
name in vain and keep his day of memorial. finally we would fulfill all the
other commandments, honoring our parents, not murdering, stealing, lying,
fornication or coveting. if we try in ourselves we will fail, but if we walk
by the spirit we will succeed. this is the ministry of the spirit and of righteousness,
which results in god being expressed through us in our daily living.


**on idols**
it is easy for young brothers to make an idol in their imagination. they may
imagine the woman they will marry some day. then they will search for someone
to fulfill that dream. this is an invisible idol. if we walk according to the
spirit we will condemn such dreams. But those who do not walk according to the
spirit may linger in their dreams and enjoy them.
