- righteousness in ch3 > calm, peace and order

out outer man is being consumed by our environment. our wives are the best ones to help
with this consuming. but as we are consumed outwardly we are being renewed inwardly.

being renewed means something is being replaced. like a tree in spring, having passed through autumn and winter (consuming) the fresh shoots are coming forth (renweing).
