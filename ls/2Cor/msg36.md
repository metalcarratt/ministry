six matters in ch 5:
- longing to be clothes upon with a transfigured body
- ambitious to please the Lord
- constrained by love to live the Lord
- new creation
- ministry of reconciliation
- gods righteousness

ch 5 is a continuation of ch 4. ch 4 ends with outward man decaying and ch5 begins with the earthly tabernacle being taken down and the desired to be clothed upon with a transfigured body. God is shaping us inwardly to fit a transfigured body. 

our longing to be transfigured makes ambitious to please the Lord.

we are constrained by love to live to the Lord. to the lord means to do what is pleasing to him. constrained by love means that love has blocked us in, like a narrow alley with only one way forward. because of this constraint we also are ambitious to please the Lord.

to live to the lord we need to put to death our natural being that we can be a mew creation.
