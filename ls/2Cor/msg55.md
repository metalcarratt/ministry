the lord gave paul transcending revelations (the third heaven, paradise). in order that
he would not be exceedingly lifted up he gave him a weakness, a thorn. Paul entreated
that it would be taken away but the lord would not. he said, my grace is sufficient for
you. Paul had to live with the weakness, enjoying the lords grace to overcome. 

the wonderful visions paul saw, the thorn working to keep him from pride, the lords grace supplying and power overshadowing, all were to "cook" Paul so he could experience the all inclusive christ.
