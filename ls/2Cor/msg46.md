to have a ministry for the needy saints we need to be reconciled to God.

Paul does not speak merely concerning giving money, he stirs up the Corinthians to enter
into the ministry of grace for the needy saints. not a fund raiser but full of life.

in acts the believers had all things common, however whenever societies have tried to
practice this they have failed. actually it requires more grace to give continually week
after week than to give everything all at one time.

affliction is a test from God to see where we are.

to be generous we need to be simple. if you are not simple you will consider a lot before
you give. the Lord was simple. he even gave the purse to judas, a thief.

we need grace to overcome the usurpation of material riches.

the believers in macedonian considered it grace to be able to participate in the ministry
to the needy saints.

the lord became poor that we might become rich. his becoming poor is the pattern
outwardly for us to follow, and his life within is the life of the one who became
poor for us.

if we give properly, what we give will become a spiritual supply of grace and life
to others, not just a giving of material things
