"I call on God." - we need to exercise our spirit when we pray by calling, not just speaking words. "O God, O Father."

"as a witness against my soul" - if Paul had only made a decision by his soul, God would witness against that. Here Paul declares he decided by his spirit.

"I determined this for myself" - this was Paul's human determination, but as someone under the control and direction of the Spirit, this is in the principle of incarnation. when Paul was looking at the lords eyes he could have the feeling whether the lord was unhappy with him forgiving or rather encouraging.

Paul spoke with much emotion, in anguish and tears, yet balanced in not wanting to lay heavy burdens even on the sinning brother. this show what he was ministering was his very being.

v10, "it is for your sake in the person of Christ". person is literally face, the part around the eyes. Paul was so intimate with christ that he conducted himself while looking into the lords eyes.

2 Cor can be considered the autobiography of Paul. in this epistle he wrote more about himself than about the lord. however Paul was a person living in intimate fellowship and contact with the Lord.
