2 cor 8:15, he who gathered much had no excess - quote from exodus 16:18. the
principle here is God will balance all his children. if we do not give he may take
away. in the end whether we gather more or less we will be equal.

2 cor 9:6, he who sows sparingly will sparingly reap. he who sows with blessings
will reap with blessings. to sow with blessings mean we spiritually bless others when we sows.
