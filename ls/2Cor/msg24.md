beholding and reflecting like a mirror - single word in greek

in order to behold and reflect the lord we need to be unveiled. if you are veiled you
may call on the lord and still not behold him.
- veiled by religious concepts. for example not believing christ can be in us
- veiled by natural concepts. for example liking a quiet place to worship meaning we cannot stand a loud place
- veiled by national character. for example not receiving something from someone of another nationality.
- veiled by the way to meet. for example preferring the practice of one locality over another.

if we are veiled, no light will be able to generate our inner being. need to pray.

> "lord, take away anything that is covering me. lord, remove my veils. take away any opinions that are veils to me. I want to be completely open, absolutely unveiled."

we need to exercise our spirit by praying. reading the word and calling on the lord with an unveiled heart. then we will behold and be transformed into the same image as the lord spirit.
