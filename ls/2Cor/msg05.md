gift can come easily, such as balaams donkey, but ministry requires time. there
is one ministry and it is formed by christ being constituted into our being. it
takes about 20y to learn some things and another 20y to be constituted. before the
age of 60 it is not likely to have this experience of ministry.

"no rest in my spirit.. did not find Titus..  went into Macedonia." Titus is the one who delivered the first epistle to the Corinthians. even though a door was opened to the gospel Paul had no rest so he went to find Titus to hear how his letter was received. this shows his concern for the churches, even more than the gospel.

Paul says the door was opened by the lord but he had no rest in his spirit. it seems the lord was both opening a door in the outward circumstances but simultaneously giving him no rest in his spirit. Paul had to make a choice and he chose the feeling in his spirit. this is truly a spiritual man.
