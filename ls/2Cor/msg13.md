first four ch of 2 cor is about qualifications of minister, which is:
1. constitution of the divine ingredients, including crucifixion and ascension
2. conducting ourselves according to this constitution. the constitution should automatically result in a change in our conduct which is the shining of the gospel
3. living a crucified life
4. longing to be raptured.
regarding longing to be raptured, this is a matter of growth in life. higher maturity results in different desires. young ones cannot be expected to have such a hope because they lack maturity.

being a minister depends on constitution. for this reason, even the young ones can be "little minister" after receiving some constitution.

"earthly tabernacle" - in the bible tabernacle is a particular word used for the dwelling place of God. thus the tabernacle is not only for us to dwell but also for god. it is for us to live and also for us to worship God.

the love of christ constrains us to live to him. to live to him is to seek to please him in all things.
