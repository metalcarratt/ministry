first four ch of 2 cor is about qualifications of minister, which is:
1. constitution of the divine ingredients, including crucifixion and ascension
2. conducting ourselves according to this constitution. the constitution should automatically result in a change in our conduct which is the shining of the gospel
3. living a crucified life
4. longing to be raptured.
regarding longing to be raptured, this is a matter of growth in life. higher maturity results in different desires. young ones cannot be expected to have such a hope because they lack maturity.

being a minister depends on constitution. for this reason, even the young ones can be "little minister" after receiving some constitution.
