the apostle paul received so much light.
all the epistles were written under this
light. he had this light because his heart
was turned to the lord and the veil had
been taken away.

2 Cor 3:17 says that the Lord is the Spirit. many in christianity do not
accept this, saying that the lord
here is not Christ but God in a
general sense. however, the context
of the verses in ch2-4 show that the
lord here should be christ specifically, not god in a general sense. 2cor 4:5 emphatically says
thar christ jesus is lord.
