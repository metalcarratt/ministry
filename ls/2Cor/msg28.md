righteousness is the expression of god. in the ot to be righteous was to keep the law,
and the ten commandments embody the law. the ten commandments are gods testimony, which
when joined with other verses points to gods image. anyone who kept the commandments
would become an expression of the God who wrote them. thus to be righteous is to express
God.

the more we enjoy the spirit the more righteous we become, and the more we express god.
