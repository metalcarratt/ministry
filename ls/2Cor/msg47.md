8:16-24 shows how careful paul was in dealing with money. he sent three brothers, all
who were well known, that no one would be suspicious. he shows here how careful he
was in dealing with money, which can either be used by the devil or by the lord.

whenever we are about to do something we should take forethought for how others may think
about a matter. we are holy but within us is something not holy, which is the devil.
our motive may be pure but the enemy can still use our actions to put suspicion in
people's hearts. take forethought means to not do things in a way that give the enemy
a way to come in. this is true with money and also between husbands and wives.

God knows our hearts but other people do not, thus we need to take forethought for how others will perceive a situation. the same is true with the opposite sex. we should not spend time alone with someone. the Lord met Nicodemus late at night, but he met the Samaritan woman out in the open at noon.

Paul was useful because he was careful, cautious and considerate.

five important matters:
- reconciling others back to God
- all fitting life
- being enlarged
- having an intimate concern
- taking forethought for what is honorable
