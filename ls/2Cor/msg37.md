paul was an ambassador of god. as an ambassador he was one with god, and as an ambassador he had a ministry to reconcile the corinthian believers to god.

two steps of reconciliation typified by the two screens in the tabernacle. all genuine
believers have passed the first screen, to enter the holy place, but we need to pass
the second screen, the veil of the flesh which has been rent, to enter the holy of holiest,
which is full reconciliation to god. the first reconciliation brings us out of sin; the second reconciliation brings us out of the flesh, the natural man and the natural being.
