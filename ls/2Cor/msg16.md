in 2 cor paul presents himself as a pattern of someone living Christ for the church life. the intro to 2 cor is not doctrinal but a personal testimony.
- his confidence was not in himself but in the God of resurrection
- not political but conducting himself in the singleness and sincerity of God
- he conducted himself in the grace of God
- one with the unchanging God

to live christ we need termination so we can base our confidence on the God of resurrection.
