we should desire to be ministers of the new covenant, those whose ministry is something
that comes from a constitution within. not seeking to be great or famous but to be a
grain of wheat, falling into the ground to die.

the apostles did not lose heart because all the things around them afforded the resurrection life an opportunity to be manifested.

the outer man is the body with the soul as its person. the inner man is the spirit as the person with the soul as its organ. the decaying of the outer man is the wearing out of the soul as the person. the person of the soul needs to be denied but the faculties of the soul need to be uplifted.

while the person of the outer man is being consumed, the faculties of the soul are being renewed. our mind is being renewed day by day. this renewing works out an eternal weight of glory.
