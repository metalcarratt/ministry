the Corinthians should have commended paul but because they didn't he had to do it
himself. if there are elders or ministers being targeted by others be should also
be bold to say something on their behalf rather than being silent.

paul did not seek the Corinthians money but them. this is a test to many of the lords workers. some would not say certain things or condemn things because of fear of their supply of money being cut off.

the Saints may be honest but Satan is crouching. if we are not careful he can take advantage of money matters.
