- [Message 04](msg04.md) - Paul conducted himself in the person of Christ (1:24-2:11)

The ministry

- [Message 09](msg09.md) - God shining into our hearts through our beholding the Lord's face (4:1-6)
- [Message 10](msg10.md) - Need to walk by faith while under the daily killing in the perplexing environments (4:7-18)
- [Message 11](msg11.md) - Ministry comes from being a grain falling into the ground and dying (4:16-18)
