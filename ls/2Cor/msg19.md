more about meat vs feathers and bones.

2 cor 3 has meat - in scribing living letters of christ.

christ is all of the letters of the alphabet (in rev he is alpha and omega, so he should also be all the letters inbetween).
it is not enough to learn or teach doctrine. we need to inscribe and be inscribed.
when something is inscribed in our heart it cannot be removed.
also, doctrine about something will not help us to live it out. we need that matter inscribed into our hearts.
