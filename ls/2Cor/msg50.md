paul cared more for the way he did things than for why he did them. this is opposite
of the saying "the end justifies the means", which is deplorable. we should also
learn this. for example some Christians may use any means, even worldly means, for 
preaching the gospel.

pauls person:
- entreating through the meekness and forbearance (gentleness) of Christ
- weak in person but bold when absent (a proper kind of boldness)
- fighting the spiritual warfare, not against flesh and blood but overthrowing reasonings and high things against the knowledge of God.

the reason people do not believe is because of the proud thoughts, high thoughts, and haughty imaginations. in particular the teachings of the judaisers was a high thought against the proper nt gospel. Paul needed the Corinthians obedience to the gospel as a base so that he could judge those who were not.
