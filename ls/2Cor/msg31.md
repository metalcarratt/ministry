ch 3 is on doctrine while ch4 is on experience of that doctrine.
ch 4 is on the manifestation of life.

- ch3 spirit > ch4 life
- ch3 righteousness > ?
- ch3 transformation > ch4 renewing
- ch3 increasing degrees of glory > ch4 eternal weight of glory

life was manifested in four ways:
- although attacked from four directions not put out of place
- without a way out but not without a way out
- persecuted but not forsaken
- cast down but not destroyed.
