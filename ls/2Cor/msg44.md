need a ministering life. not good enough to be holy, spiritual, victorious, but also need
to be fruitful. like a fruit tree
that is growing and full of green leaves but has no fruit. we are not fruitful because we do not have a ministering life. 

to be fruitful also need the intimate concern of a ministering life. a mother may not have skill but will raise her children well if she has intimate concern. if we try to shepherd the saints or care for the churches without intimate concern we may kill rather than help the saints.
