if we are not reconciled to God we will be at enmity with Him. our need is further
reconciliation.

6:1 - to receive the grace of god in vain means to recieve grace without making any
progress in the matter of being saved.
6:2 - now is the day for us to receive daily salvation, that the grace we have already
received would work in us to reconcile us further into God.

Paul encourages the Corinthians to have an enlarged heart. to have an all fitting
life is to be enlarged. for example, for a man or woman to forgive and forget the
offenses of their husband or wife against them requires an enlarged heart.
