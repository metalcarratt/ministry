for forty days the Lord appeared to His disciples speaking to them about the kingdom
of God. although we do not know what was said, it was probably a re speaking of what
was spoken in the gospels. in the gospels the disciples did not have the Lord in them,
thus they did not have the spiritual insight to understand what the Lord was speaking.
thus after regenerating them He must have come to re speak so that they could understand.

the kingdom of God is the life of God. before regeneration the disciples did not have
this life, so they could not understand this kingdom. but after having received this life
they could now know and understand this kingdom.
