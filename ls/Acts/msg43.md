sharp contention between Paul and Barnabas. barnabas probably leaned on his natural
personality, which was kind and lenient, and also his blood relationship, in wanting
to take Mark along. we can guess he was in the wrong because he no longer appears in
the divine record. also, when Paul went out with Silas he was commended by the brothers,
further proving tbat he was still one with the Lord.

Paul circumcising Timothy. Paup contended in Jerusalem against circumcision and wrote
strongly in the book of Galatians against circumcision. In Galatians he said when he
went up to Jerusalem he brought Titus who was not compelled to be circumcised. why
then did he circumcise Timothy. we can only guess he did it to keep the door open for
the gospel among the Jews, who were so strong in their tradition.
