the Lord used the time after His resurrection to further train His disciples. Part
of this training required the Lord to be the Spirit to get into them. without this
He had no way to regenerate, recreate or indwell. i.e. He could not "propogate"
Himself.

> with Peter and the other disciples, the Lord Jesus did not have a way in His flesh to propogate Himself. For the Lord to propogate Himself is for Him to impart Himself into others as life.

after His resurrection His appearing to the disciples were to train them to know His invisible presence.

> His manifestations, or appearings, after His resurrection were to train the disciples to realize, enjoy, and practice His invisible presence, which is more available, prevailing, precious, rich, and real than His visible presence.
