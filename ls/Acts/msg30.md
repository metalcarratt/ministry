Peter's message included:
- the living and ministry of the Lord Jesus
- His death and resurrection
- His being the judge of all men (Jew and Gentile)
- the need to receive forgiveness of sins

The Spirit fell on those of Cornelius' household without the laying on of the hands
of the brothers and before their water baptism, as proof that this was a move of the
Lord Himself to save the Gentiles.

the Spirit poured out was a gift from the ascended Head. This is the work of the Lord
in ascension in His heavenly ministry
