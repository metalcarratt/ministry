paul was a tent maker by trade, and used his tent making to support himself and
the other co workers under his care. he had a burden for the ministry, and if the
means had provided he would have used them to serve full time, but since they did
not, he did not give up his burden, but rather, "laboured day and night" to support
himself and others.

when the lord was ministering many sisters supported his need. one sister was the
wife of a roman politician and used her husband's money to support the Lord. many
times the situation is like this, with the sisters being the ones to support the
lord's work financially.
