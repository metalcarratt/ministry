paul was a tent maker by trade, and used his tent making to support himself and
the other co workers under his care. he had a burden for the ministry, and if the
means had provided he would have used them to serve full time, but since they did
not, he did not give up his burden, but rather, "laboured day and night" to support
himself and others.

when the lord was ministering many sisters supported his need. one sister was the
wife of a roman politician and used her husband's money to support the Lord. many
times the situation is like this, with the sisters being the ones to support the
lord's work financially.

Paul sheared his head as a vow. this was an old testament practice but was tolerated by the Lord, perhaps because he did it privately and far away from Jerusalem. the vow was a thanksgiving. some expositors believe it was because Paul was in fear of his life many times because of the Jews. when the lord appeared to him in a vision he said "do not be afraid." thus this vow may have been thanksgiving to the Lord for preserving his life. some may ask how paul could have fear when he had the essential and economical spirit, but thr lord still came in in a strong way to encourage him showing he must have had some fear.

before Paul ended his second ministry journey he first went to Jerusalem and then Antioch. his reason for going to Jerusalem must have been to preserve the oneness. because of him many gentiles were turning to the lord, and because of this the matter of circumcision became a problem. this is why he and barnabas had to visit jerusalem the first time. knowing that he was a source of problem he went to jerusalem in order to maintain peace and oneness with the church there.
