the lord's ascension physically into the clouds strengthened the disciples faith
in His death and resurrection. this was also a part of the Lord's education.

after returning they persevered "with one accord in prayer." before they had no heart
for prayer but condented and fought with one another. but now their spiritual condition
had changed.

"with one accord" can be translated "with one mind"

the disciples most likely prayed for the fulfillment of the Lord's promises:
- the promise of the Father (power from on high, Luke 24:49)
- the Lord's commission (to proclaim His name to the nations, beginning from Jerusalem, Luke 24:47)
- to be His witnesses bearing His testimony (Luke 24:48)

> God wanted to pour out His Spirit for the carrying out of His New Testament economy, and He had promised to do this. Yet He needed His chosen people to pray for it. As God in heaven, He needs men on earth to cooperate with Him for the carrying out of His plan. The one hundred twenty disciples praying for ten days met this need of God.
