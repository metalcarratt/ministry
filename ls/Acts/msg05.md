the lord's ascension physically into the clouds strengthened the disciples faith
in His death and resurrection. this was also a part of the Lord's education.

after returning they persevered "with one accord in prayer." before they had no heart
for prayer but condented and fought with one another. but now their spiritual condition
had changed.

"with one accord" can be translated "with one mind"
