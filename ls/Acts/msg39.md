in chapter 14 Paul uses the expression the word of grace. Paul was an excellent miner
of the Old Testament. while the jews read the old testament and only saw the law, Paul
was able to read the old testament and find the words of God's grace in it. there are
many words of God's grace in the old testament. for example in Genesis, after Adam and Eve
sinned God should have come in with punishment but instead came with a prkmise that the
seed of the woman would crush the head of the serpent. God also made a promise to Abraham
that all the earth would be blessed in him. In Isaiah He prophisied of the coming of
Emmanuel and the Son born who would be the mighty God and eternal Father. Paul was able to see that Psalm 2 refers to Christ in resurrection
as the Firstborn Son of God and that in Psalm 89 the sure mercies of David are
all Christ is to us in resurrection. 

Paul was also wise in his preaching. to the jews he used the old testament, preaching to
them concerning Christ's resurrection, but to the gentiles he preached from God's creation. 
he told those in lyconia that God had been merciful to them in ages gone by, giving them
rain and gladness. this touched their hearts. this was the wisdom of Paul in preaching
according to the listener's understanding and appreciation.
