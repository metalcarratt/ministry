God purchased the church with His own blood. this expression needs careful attention.
how can God have blood? He can have blood because He became a man, a God-man. As a God-man,
when He died on the cross it was God's blood who was shed.

Jesus had God as the Spirit essentially within Him all the time, but God as the Spirit
economically came upon Him at the time of His baptism, and left Him (forsook Him)
when He was judged on the cross.
