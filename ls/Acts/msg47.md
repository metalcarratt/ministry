Paul used the scriptures when speaking with the Jews, unveiling to them to incarnated, crucified and resurrected Chrisr contained in them, and he used God's creation and his knowledge of Greek culture when speaking to the Gentiles. At Athens specifically, his speaking touched the epicurian philosophy which says there is no god and no future and that we should thus enjoy life. Paul spoke of God as the one in whom we live and breath, whose offspring we are in creation, and who has designated Jesus as the judge of the earth in the future. He speaking also touched the stoic philosophy who believed in many gods.

Paul could speak in such a way because of his education and upbringing, which included knowledge of the scriptures as well as greek culture and roman politics. When he spoke he could use these things to touch the ones he was speaking to. However what he spoke was not culture or knowledge but the resurrected Christ who was his livong and person.
