principles of gospel preaching:
- accomoplished through the scattering (migrating) of the saints
- concerning Jesus Christ and the kingdom of God (a high gospel, the gospel of the divine seed sown into us to develop into a realm where God can rule)
- through the Word primarily, (not stories and illustrations)
