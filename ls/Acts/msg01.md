Acts is a continuation of Luke. Luke covers the Lord's conception, birth, human living,
death, resurrection amd ascension. his conception was His coming from heaven to earth,
and His ascension was His going from earth back to heaven. on earth His ministry was His
living, the living of a God man. In ascension His ministry didnt stop, but an initiation
into a further ministry, a ministry in the heavens.
