Acts is a continuation of Luke. Luke covers the Lord's conception, birth, human living,
death, resurrection amd ascension. his conception was His coming from heaven to earth,
and His ascension was His going from earth back to heaven. on earth His ministry was His
living, the living of a God man. In ascension His ministry didnt stop, but an initiation
into a further ministry, a ministry in the heavens.

in his first book Luke describes the ministry of the Lord on the earth; in his secon book Luke describes the living and ministry of the Lord in heaven.

> after His resurrection the Lord Jesus ascended to the heavens. This ascension was not a termination but another initiation. This initiation brought Him into a new realm, that is, into the heavens, where He now has another living with another ministry. This living and ministry are carried out not by the Jesus who was merely conceived of the Holy Spirit in the womb of a virgin and born in Bethlehem; it is carried out by the ascended Christ. The resurrected and ascended Christ is now living in the heavens and ministering there. The Lord's living and ministry in the heavens are the contents of the book of Acts. May we all be impressed with this picture at the outset of this Life-Study of Acts.
