some points:
- wherever Paul went he visited the brothers. this was his practising of the Body life
- Paul already had a feeling in his spirit that bonds lay before him in Jerusalem, but this time twice the Lord prophesied through other members, and those travelling with him, including Luke tried to persuade him not to go, but he would not listen. in this matter Paul, who practised the Body life, should have listened to the speaking of the Body to him
