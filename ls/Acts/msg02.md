the Christ in Acts is the ascended Christ. in His ascension he is very active.

> we should never think that the ascended Christ is sitting passively on the throne, observing the pitiful situation on the earth and feeling disappointed about it. No, in His ascension Christ is active in a very positive way. As the ascended One He is now doing many things.

the Lord was standing while Stephen was being stoned, possibly remarking that while they were stoning Stephen He was working to gain Paul.

being in ascension means Christ has power and authority.

> All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth.
Matt. 28:18

in Acts the Lord is doing a work in ascension. His work of propogation is a work
