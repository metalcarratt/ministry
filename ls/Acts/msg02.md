the Christ in Acts is the ascended Christ. in His ascension he is very active.

> we should never think that the ascended Christ is sitting passively on the throne, observing the pitiful situation on the earth and feeling disappointed about it. No, in His ascension Christ is active in a very positive way. As the ascended One He is now doing many things.

in Acts the Lord is doing a work in ascension. His work of propogation is a work 
in ascension. it is also by the spirit, particularly the economical Spirit.

> We need to realise that the propogation of the resurrected Christ is by the Spirit, in particular, the economical Spirit.
