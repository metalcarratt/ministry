Although the Lord was God, Peter's message emphasised Him as a man, because it was as a man
that the people despised and crucified Him.

Peter's instruction to those who responded to his word:
- to repent, a change of mind with regret for the past and a turn for the future
- to be baptized upon the name of Jesus Christ
- receiving forgiveness of sins
- receiving the gift of the Holy Spirit (the Lord Himself, not an outward gift)
