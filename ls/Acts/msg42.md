Peter's testimony at the conference. peter referred to God's accepting the Gentiles
through his ministry, cleansing their hearts by faith, that they were testing God, and
that God has saved the Gentiles by grace. however his testimony was weak. Peter had some authority
given to him by God. they were not
only testing God but nulkllifying His economy.  furthermore in Acts 1:8 the Lord told him and the other disciples
that they would be His witnesses unto samaria and the uttermost part of the earth. Peter
also receieved a vision of the sheet with the animals and the charge to slay and eat. He
also witnessed the Spirit falling on the Gentiles when theh believed in Cornelius' house.
Peter should have been strong to testify of these things. the Lord was bold when He
talked about the widow of Sidon and Namaan the Syrian. Peter should have been the same.
if he had been bold at the beginning there would have been no need for so much discussion.
