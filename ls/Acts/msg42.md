Peter's testimony at the conference. peter referred to God's accepting the Gentiles
through his ministry, cleansing their hearts by faith, that they were testing God, and
that God has saved the Gentiles by grace. however his testimony was weak. Peter had some authority
given to him by God. they were not
only testing God but nulkllifying His economy.  furthermore in Acts 1:8 the Lord told him and the other disciples
that they would be His witnesses unto samaria and the uttermost part of the earth. Peter
also receieved a vision of the sheet with the animals and the charge to slay and eat. He
also witnessed the Spirit falling on the Gentiles when theh believed in Cornelius' house.
Peter should have been strong to testify of these things. the Lord was bold when He
talked about the widow of Sidon and Namaan the Syrian. Peter should have been the same.
if he had been bold at the beginning there would have been no need for so much discussion.

James' testimony was also very weak. he quoted a verse from the old testament that
uplifted the nation of Israel, and does not even relate to the current period of grace. He concluded that Moses has those who speak him in synagogues all throughout the earth, showing how much mixture he had. James was very weak in opposing
the juaisers. on the contrary both the Lord and Paup were strong to say that the reason God has gone to the Gentiles is because the nation of Israel rejected Him. this is quite different from how James spoke.

the result was a compromise. the "fox" of circumcision was buried, but the "tail" of abstaining from blood, etc were not. this compromise existed in acts 15 and
worsened in acts 21. even Pauo got caught up with a vow and later the nazarite vow. today we need to be strong to stand against compromise, for example concerning
Christ as the Spirit or the matter of the church.
