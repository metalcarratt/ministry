Paul's ministry was prevailing in Ephesus, and this caused an uproar. here there
are two principles: if we stay in a certain place for a long period of time our
ministry should be prevailing, and if this is the case there should be opposition,
since Satan and the kingdom of darkness will oppose it. we should not seek to
create an uproar--that is itself something of darkness, but we should not be
discouraged if our ministry stirs up opposition, rather we should be encouraged.

the behaviour of the people in ephesus was foolish and even laughable. it was not
logical, because it was stirred up by demons. the real ones at threat from pauls
preaching were the demons who are behind the idols. paul was part of a great battle
between satans kindgom and gods.
