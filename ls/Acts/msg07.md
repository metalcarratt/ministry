there is a clear difference between the breathing of the Spirit in John 20 and the outpouring
of the Spirit in Acts 2. the breathing is for the essential Spirit, for life, and the
outpouring of the Spirit is for the economical Spirit, for power and for
authority.

the essential Spirit is like a policeman needing water to drink and the economical
spirit is like that policeman needing a uniform to represent authority. the water
does no give him authority and the uniform does not quench his thirst. both are needed.

both of these are facts, whether we feel like it or not. just as we believe in the
crucifixion whether we feel it or not, so we must believe in the breathing in of
the essential Spirit and the blowing of the economical Spirit.
