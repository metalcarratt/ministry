Paul's conversion 2:
- for three days he could not see, and he did not eat or drink. he only prayed
- while he was praying a heavenly vision was televised into him
- He called Jesus as Lord without even knowing who He was
- He understood Jesus means Jehovah the Saviour
- he saw the vision of the corporate "Me", whom he has been persecuting
- economically filled with the Spirit after being confirmed by a member of the Body, Ananias
- Paul eventually completed the NT revelation
- God told Ananias that Paul was a chosen vessel. Ananias likely told Paul this, and Paul used this term multiple times. He was a vessel to be filled with God to contain and convey Christ to man.
