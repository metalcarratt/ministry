Peter did not have silver or gold but he had something much better - the name, the Person
of Jesus Christ, the One despised and forsaken by the Jesus.

in speaking to those amazed at the miracle, Peter turned their attention from the healing miracle to the Healer Himself.

Peter referred to God as the God of Abrahamx Isaac and Jacob. This points back to the Lord's word that being the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob implies resurrection, since He is the God of the living, not of the dead. Thus Peter was pointing the people to Him as the God of resurrection.

Peter said that this God glorified His servant Jesus. He glorified Him by resurrecting Him.
