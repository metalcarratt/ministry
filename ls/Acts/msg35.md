the initiation of the new move:
- by prophets and teachers from many different racial and social economic sources
- the gifts of these ones manifested by the growth in life, not appointed in an organisational way
- the support for Paul and Barnabas was not by raising funds in a human organisational way--they went out trusting in the Lord to meet their needs
- there is a need of many to serve full time in this way, with manifested gifts and trusting the Lord to provide for their needs
