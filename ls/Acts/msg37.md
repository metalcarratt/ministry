Paul went to the synagogue to preach the gospel. He knew the place where those who feared
God were most likely gathered. the Lord said He would call those from the fold as well
as those not of the fold into the flock. Paul's going to the synagogue was going to
the fold to find those who were the Lord's. there he also found some gentiles who
feared God.

paul started by reading from the word of God, which at the time was just the old
testament. then he presented a picture of Christ as the descendent of David, who
was crucified and resurrected, and in resurrection was begotten as God's firstborn Son.
