four things related to the initiation of the church life: teaching, fellowship,
breaking of bread, prayers.

the teaching and fellowship are of the apostles, meaning we should have only one
teaching and one fellowship. the one teaching of the apostles is the 27 books of the
new testament as a record of the apostle's speaking. As Paul said to Timothy, we should
not have any other teaching than what is revealed in these books.

fellowship mean join participation. it means to put away private interests and join
with others to fulfill a common goal or purpose. what goal or purpose do we join
with others to pursue? this is the fellowship of the apostles, which is the joint
fellowship with the Triune God, to carry out God's purpose on earth.

the fellowship of the apostles is only one. all genuine believers are included in
this fellowship, regardless of where they were saved and baptised, or what nationality they are. if a group limits their fellowship to only those baptised by them, or only people of a certain nationality or race, that is another fellowship, not the fellowship of the apostles.
