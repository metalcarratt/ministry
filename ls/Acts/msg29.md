The Lord made a definite move toward the Gentile world through Peter. for this He
appeared the a vision to both of them. this was a part of Peter's ministry to use
the keys of the kingdom to unlock both the Jewish and Gentile world.

my thought: its amazing how the Lord was progressing, from Judea to Gaililee and Samaria,
to Ethiopia and now to a Roman in Ceasarea. this was His work in ascension. He also
raised up and used certain ones to work out His purpose: Peter, Stephen, Philip, Paul,
and later John. it's also interesting that the work the Lord led them to do when
they were younger was more outward - preaching the Word, raising up churches, spreading
the kingdom to the Gentile lands. However when they were older Paul, Peter and John all
wrote something to complete the ministry. this is the lords deeper work.

both with the preaching to the ethiopian eunuch and to cornelius, both gentiles, an angel appeared. the angel appeared because both these cases were special, however the angels were used but they themselves did not preach the gospel as only human beings have the privilege of bringing the good news to others.

prayer - the vision came to both cornelius and peter while they were praying. this shows the importance of prayer. furthermore they were ones who prayed in a scheduled way, at set times. if we have such a prayer life we will be used by the Lord for the spreading of His recovery.

the gentiles were symbolised by many unclean animals, whom the jews were forbidden to assoicate with. this ordinance from leviticus became a great obstacle to the spreading of the gospel. but in the vision peter is told not to consider thoae cleansed by the Lord as unclean.
