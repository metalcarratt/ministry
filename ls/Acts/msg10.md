Peter's message
- Christ's death - according to God's determinee council and foreknowledge
- Christ's resurrection - As a man He was resurrected by God to demonstrate God's approval of Him, but as God He rose Himself, being unable to be held by death. he was also taught the "ways of life", which are the ways to get out of death and into resurrection (by knowing the gladness of the Father's presence?)
- Christ's ascension - as a man He was crowned the Lord and re-anointed as the Christ. also the Father is working to put all enemies beneath His feet and has given to Him of the economical Spirit to be poured out upon the church.
