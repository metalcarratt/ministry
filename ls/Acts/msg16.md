Christ as the Stone-Saviour:
- when the Lord first called Simon he named him Peter, meaning a stone
- when Peter said that He is the Christ the Lord said he is Peter (a stone) and upon this rock the Lord would build His church
- here in Acts Peter said the Lord is the cornerstone rejected by the builders
- later in his epistle Peter said that He and we are living stones being built up as into a spiritual house
- to the Gentiles the Lord is the stone of stumbling, and the smitting stone
- in Daniel 2 He crushes Satan's kingdom as the smitting stone and becomes a mountain to fill the whole earth
- He is the propogating stone, making us into living stones
