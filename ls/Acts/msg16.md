Christ as the Stone-Saviour (according to Peter):
- when the Lord first called Simon he named him Peter, meaning a stone
- when Peter said that He is the Christ the Lord said he is Peter (a stone) and upon this rock the Lord would build His church
- here in Acts Peter said the Lord is the cornerstone rejected by the builders
- later in his epistle Peter said that He and we are living stones being built up as into a spiritual house (as such He is the propogating stone, making us living stones)
- to the Gentiles the Lord is the stone of stumbling, and the smitting stone
- in Daniel 2 He crushes Satan's kingdom as the smitting stone and becomes a mountain to fill the whole earth

other mentions of stone in the Bible:
- in Genesis the river had gold, silver and bdellium
- in exodus the briestplate had twelve stones and onyx stones were on the shoulders of the ephod
- the cleft rock which followed the children of Israel was a spiritual rock according to 1 Corinthians.
- Isaiah says He is the foundation stone laid in Zion, a tried stone, a precious stone.
- In Zechariah He is the head stone with shoutings of "grace, grace to it"
- in 1 Corinthians Paul says we build upon the foundation with gold, silver and precious stone.
- in revelation God is sitting on the throne with the appearance of Jasper and  the new jerusalem has twelve foundations of precious stones.
