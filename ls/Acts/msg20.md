God was making a transfer from the old covenant, which included the dispensation of the 
law and the temple, to the new covenant, which was the dispensation of Christ as
the law of life and the living temple. however it was very difficult for the early
judaic church to separate themselves. eventually God had to come in to destroy the
temple to clear up the mixture of the church in Jerusalem.

today Christianity has also made the things of the new covenant into a tradition. we need a strong definite transfer out of the traditional things and into Christ as our reality.
