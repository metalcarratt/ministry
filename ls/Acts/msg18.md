> it may seem that kings and presidents rule the earth and that the Lord Jesus is not on the throne. Nevertheless, this one who seems not to be on the throne is the ruler of all the enthroned ones. Today the entire world is under the Lord's ruling. He is truly the Leader, the chief Ruler.


> when the "sky" above us is not clear and we are in a "cloudy" situation spiritually speaking, we may begin to consider that the Lord has caught us, even trapped us. We may also believe that we are caught in the church life. There is no way for us to escape from the Lord's "trap".

> before we were saved, we were like mice running loose. But the Lord Jesus exercised His sovereign authority to set up a trap to catch us. The faster we ran, the easier it was for Him to catch us. In this matter He is sovereign.
