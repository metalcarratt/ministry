Peter and the apostles set up seven brothers to handle the matter of "tables"
so that they could focus on the ministry of the word and prayer. this is an
important principle and lesson in the church. brother Lee said other thing he
is unusually capable but he is not. he had just learned how to distribute
responsibility to others. when he had to leave a certain churche it was easy
because everything was already being taken care of by others. if someone asked
him a question about how something was being done he would often not know and ask
them to ask the elders or deacons. this is an important principle for us.
