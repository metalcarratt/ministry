Peter and the apostles set up seven brothers to handle the matter of "tables"
so that they could focus on the ministry of the word and prayer. this is an
important principle and lesson in the church. brother Lee said others think he
is unusually capable but he is not. he had just learned how to distribute
responsibility to others. when he had to leave a certain church it was easy
because everything was already being taken care of by others. if someone asked
him a question about how something was being done he would often not know and ask
them to ask the elders or deacons. this is an important principle for us.

two of the brothers chosen to serve tables were Stephen and Pbilip. one of these was a great teacber of the word and the other a powerful evangelist. however they did not complain when they were asked to serve tables. they did not regard serving tables below their gift. also serving tables did not prevent the manifestation of their gift. therefore we should be willing to accept the Lords sovereignty and placement of us in the church.
