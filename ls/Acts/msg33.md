acts 11 is a further move of the lord in preparing Paul for his ministry to the
gentile world.

paul was not someone raised up apart from what the lord began in jerusalem or what
the lord was doing through Peter. his ministry was all part of the same one stream. he was originally from jerusaelm, and after being saved in damascus and gaining some diaciples there he was sent back to jerusalem because of persecution. this forced him to be related to the brothers there.

in acts 11 those from jerusalem were scattered as far as antioch. but they spoke to jews only. some spoke to the gentiles also in antioch. barnabas was sent out out glorified God for the grace of God among the believers. he found paul and brought him to antioch. then prophets came from jerusalem and signified there would be a famine in judea. the brothers in antioch sent an offering through barnabas and paul. through all these steps paul was brought in to the ministry, but not in a way that was separate to ehat he had begun with peter and the other brothers in jerusalem.

- paul first heard the gospel at stephens martrdom which was in jerusalem
- paul was forced back to jerusalem from damascus by persecution where others were afraid to associate with him
- paul was brougbt by barnabas to the apostles, connecting him to the ministry
- after more persecution he was sent out to tarsus
- later barnabas found him again and brought him to antioch
- because of the famine paul and barnabas went to jerusalem to deliver the offering of the saints, once again connecting him to the apostles there.

there is also a strong sense that the stream was moving toward the gentile world, which required paul as there was such a strong resistance against preaching to the gentilrs. this is interesting because it shows that while the lord had strong intent to spread the gospel to the gentiles, he wouldnt do it in a loose careless way apart from what he had raised up in the jewish world. rather he would meticulously arrange things so that the church as his body would spread in one accord with both jewish and gentile believers.
