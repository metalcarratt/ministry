"continue in the faith" - faith here is objective, it is the contents of God's NT economy
as the truth. previously Paul entreated them to continue in the grace of God, whicb is
God as our enjoyment, but here Paul entreated them to continue in the faith, that is to
know and experience all the aspects of God's NT economy. This is deeper because it
requires the believers exercise to get into and know the truth.

"enter into the kingdom of God" - this is not just an outward objective kingdom over
which God rules as the King, but Christ Himself as the kingdom seed within us.
