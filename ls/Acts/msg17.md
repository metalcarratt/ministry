when ananias and saphira lied Peter said Satan had filled their heart. some believe
that a saved person cannot be demon possessed, but here we see Satan had filled their
heart. also Peter himself, when he rebuked the Lord was called Satan. Peter said they
lied to the Holy Spirit. this One they lied to was the Spirit within them. from this
we see that not only the Lord is in us but Satan as well.

ambition is a tool Satan uses to deceive us and brings in spiritual death.
