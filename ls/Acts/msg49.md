when Paul preached the He spoke only concerning tbe resurrected Christ. we may
think to gain people we need to speak something extra, or to have some "opener" or
stories, but we need to realise the central topic of our speaking should just be
Christ.

furthermore, our power comes not from speaking in tongues or anything else, but by
prayer, the Spirit and the Word. we have power when we speak because we pray. we
also have power because when we speak we speak only the Word, not any other
nonsensical things. there is power in the Word.
