when Paul preached the He spoke only concerning tbe resurrected Christ. we may
think to gain people we need to speak something extra, or to have some "opener" or
stories, but we need to realise the central topic of our speaking should just be
Christ.

furthermore, our power comes not from speaking in tongues or anything else, but by
prayer, the Spirit and the Word. we have power when we speak because we pray. we
also have power because when we speak we speak only the Word, not any other
nonsensical things. there is power in the Word.

> perhaps you would say, "brother Lee, you have been in the Word for over fifty years. How can we be powerful in preaching the gospel if we are still young in the Lord?" Let me testify to you that even when I was young my speaking was powerful because of these three matters of prayer, the Word and the Spirit, the anointing. This indicates that even the young saints can preach the gospel with power and impact if theh trust in prayer, the Word, and the Spirit.

> Young saints, you can take a portion of the Word and preach it to others. Only do not trust in any eloquence you might have. Those who are eloauent in speaking may not have any power or impact. But those who are not eloquent, and sho amy even misprounounce words, may have impact and power in their gospel preaching. If we trust in prayer, the Word, and the Spirit, the Lord may even using speaking with the wrong proununciation of words to save others.
