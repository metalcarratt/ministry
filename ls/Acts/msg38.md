#### the holy things, the faithful things

> And as to His having raised Him up from the dead, no longer to return to corruption, He spoke in this way, “I will give you the holy things of David, the faithful things.”
Acts 13:34

"the holy things, the faithful things" here literally means the "the holy things", "the mercies".
it is the plural of the word "Holy One" in v35, `And as to His having raised Him up from the dead, no longer to return to corruption, He spoke in this way, “I will give you the holy things of David, the faithful things.”`

it is the same words used in these places:

> I will sing of the **lovingkindness** of Jehovah forever; / From generation to generation I will make known Your faithfulness with my mouth.

Psalm 89

> Incline your ear and come to Me; / Hear, so that your soul may live; / And I will make an eternal covenant with you, / Even the sure **mercies** shown to David.

Isaiah 55:3

> O Jehovah God, do not turn away the face of Your anointed one, / Remember Your **lovingkindness** to David Your servant.

2 Chronicles 6:42

These holy things, these mercies, are all the aspects of what Christ is to us in resurrection, such as life, light and grace. whatever He is to us is a real mercy to us from God.

#### forgiveness and justification

these are also Christ as mercies given to us by God

#### continue in the grace

God has given Christ to as mercies, holy things, faithful things. but practically what we enjoy is just grace. grace is our enjoyment of Christ as the mercies given to us by God.
