the teaching that unless you are circumcised according to the law of moses you
cannot be saved is a heresy that nullifies Christ's death, resurrection, ascension
and all He taught. this teaching did not appear out of nowhere. it must have first
taken root in Jerusalem before it could spread to Antioch. therefore Peter and James
must have known about it. they have to bear the responsibility for not guarding the
truth and contending for it properly, as Paul did when these ones came to Antioch.
