acts 11 shows how difficult it was for the jews to make the transfer from the old
covenant to the new. acts is a book of a dispensational transfer. the lord told
them in acts 1:8 that they would be his witnesses unto samaria and the uttermost part
of the earth, which implies the preaching of the gospel to the gentiles and a transfer
from the old dispensation to the new, but probably the disciples did not understand
this at all. to hear is one thing but to realise and experience is another.

- first Peter himself was cautious. for this reason he took six brothers when he went to meet cornelius. this was the principle of the body, but from Peter's perspective it was probably for his protection.
- second at jerusalem "those of the circumcision" disputed and accused him of eating with a gentile.
- third Peter's account is excellent but perhaps a bit cowardly, emphasising how the Lord had accepted them and it was not of him.
- fourth v18 says "**then** they were silent", indicating surprise and unwillingness on those who heard Peter's report.
