Saul's conversions #3:
- "immediately proclaiming" - Paul's turn was very fast
- "this One" - the One known to all in recent days
- "the Son of God" - proclaiming the Lord's Person, which was Divine, a fact rejected by the Jews
- "the Christ" - referring to His commission and work
- the person and work of Christ should be the primary component of our gospel preaching
- "his disciples" - Paul was let down the wall by "his" disciples, showing the power of his gospel preaching

throughout history there have beeb mistaken beliefs regarding the Lord's Person:
- that He is not still a man
- that He didn't come in the flesh
- that He isn't a creature
