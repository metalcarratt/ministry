after seeing the vision Paup and the brother concluded that God had called them
to bring the good news to macedonia. although they had the vision they still need
to exercise the mind, saturated with the Spirit of God, and according to the
actual situation and environment, to come to a conclusion.

after paul was released from prison he claimed his right as a roman. some may
wonder why he had this attitude toward persecution, behaving as a "hawk" rather
than a "lamb". the reason was for the continuation of his ministry to the
gentile world. by appealing to his citizenship he taught the roman officials
that they could not treat him as they wished. this was to protect his ministry
as he progressed further into the gentile world.

br lee applies this to the demation appeal the brothers did in the US to
protect the publication work from the name of 'a cult'.
