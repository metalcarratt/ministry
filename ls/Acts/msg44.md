two divine titles: the Holy Spirit and the Spirit of Jesus. these titles cannot be
found in the old testament. the Holy Spirit is related to the Lord's incarnation and
birth, and the Spirit of Jesus is related to His human living, crucifixion, 
resurrection and ascension, in which He has been made Lord and Christ. Acts 16:7 is
a turn from the Holy Spirit to the Spirit of Jesus.

the kind of Spirit we have dictates the kind of direction and work we will do. Elijah
had the Spirit of power and the Spirit of Jehovah, so he could do works of power, 
but he did not have the Holy Spirit or the Spirit of Jesus, so he could not be led like
Paul was, to bypass Galatia and Bithynia, andhe could not do a work like Paul did,
of ministering and conveying the all-inclusive Christ to others.
