"Ministering to the Lord" - there were two places the priests in the ot could minister. Ministering to the people was done at the altar in the outer court, but ministering to the Lord was done at the incense altar in the holy of holies. Therefore to say the brothers in antioch were ministering to the lord means they were in the holy place at the incense altar before the lord.

"Set apart unto Me" - proves the Spirit is the Lord, otherwise He (the Spirit) would not have commanded them to be set apart unto "Me".

This also shows the move the the gentile world was initiated by the Lord Himself as the Spirit, not by any human organisation or method.

Paul and Barnabas were went both by the other brothers and by the Spirit. This shows their oneness with the Spirit. The brothers also laid hands on them. This is for identification in the Spirit, to go with them in oneness and in prayer, not for ordination or the following of a ritual.


Acts 16 is a pattern for a new turn, unlike the initiation of the church in Jerusalem, which began with the Lord's calling the twelve disciples and being with them for 3.5 years, which is something special and wilo not be repeated. The new turn in Acts 16 is a pattern that can be copied.

Peter was called to be a "fisher of men", but Paul was called to be a "chosen vessel". He was a vessel of Christ, bringing Christ to the Gentile world to impart Him into many other vessels.
