paul was being persecuted by the jews but the gospel was also wide open. he had a
desire both to go to Rome and back to jerusalem. at a time when the gospel was ooen
and his ministry was prevailing he was concerned for jerusalem. apparantly this was
because he wanted to help the needy saints there. actually he should have been bothered
by the mixture there and wanted to go back to clear it up. this shows that no matter
how prevailing his work was he was concerned for the body. even though peter had been given
the ministry to the jews and paul to the gentiles, he still had a concern for the churcb
in jerusalem because he cared for the one body.
