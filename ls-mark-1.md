The gospel of Mark is primarily concerned with the Lord's move in Galilee, contrary to the gospel of John which is primarily about His move in Judea.

Mark presents the Lord as a slave. This view is apparantly lower than the other gospels, such as John who presents the Lord in His divinity, or Matthew who presents the Lord as a King. However as a slave the Lord is the most approachable One. We need to appreciate Him in this aspect.

Mark talks more about the Lord's acts than His words. It doesn't record His sermons, teachings, prophesies or many of His parables. Instead Mark uses many examples to show the beauty of His humanity.

The gospel of Mark can also be considered as the gospel of Peter.
