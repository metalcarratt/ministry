# Message Four - Being in the reality of the Body of Christ by living in the resurrection life of Christ

Phil. 3:10-11

The Lord's experience on the earth was first death and then resurrection. There are verses showing the connection between living a crucified and resurrection life. 2 Cor. about the God of resurrection giving life to the dead. In Eph. 2 we see another aspect. To know Him and the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death. SUfferings and death are not first. THey were wit hChrist but not with us. We want to know Him in all inclusiveness. We wantt to know the power of His resurrection. To give some impression on the power of Christ's resurrection we read in Eph. 1:19-20 this:

> and what is the surpsassing greatness of his power toward us who believe, according to the operation of the might of his strength.

what powerful words. The surpassing greatness of his power toward us. We simply believe.

> which he caused to operate in Christ in raising him from the dead and seating him at his right hand in the heavenlies.

When God raised Christ from the dead, that was an application of the surpassing greatness of His power along with the operation of the might of his strength. Power, might, strength. God cause this power, might and strength to operate in Christ in raising him from the dead. This is the power of Christ's resurrection. Death cannot hold the resurrection power. So, in our experience of learning Christ, we experience the power of His resurrection. It is by the power of Christ's resurrection operating in us, that enables us to live the life of the cross, the life of the fellowship of His sufferings. Enables us to be conformed to His death. Conformed implies a mould. If our wives want to make some kind of cookies, they have dough, etc, they press the ingredients into the mould and then they heat it. Well, to be conformed to Christ's death requires that we be shaped by being in the mould and none of us are very good at staying in the mould of Christ's death. Certain situations put us there or we're just exercising our spirit. Other times we come springing out of the mould so many times. I'm driving my car and while I'm driving I'm in the Lord, in the Spirit, then someone cuts in front of me and I react, I leap out of the mould. I just sprang out. So, it is only by the power of Christ's resurrection that we can really experience the fellowship of Christ's sufferings and live a crucified life.

The sequence is important. Paul had a goal. To attain the out-resurrection from the dead. Within him this life was operating. Footnote: arrive at. He is on a journey and the goal is the out-resurrection. Note 2 on verse 11, the outstanding resurrection, the extra resurrection, a prize to the overcoming saints. All believers dead in Christ will participate in the resurrection at the Lord's coming back. But the overcomers will enjoy and extra outstanding portion of that resurrection.

Lord, grant me the grace and mercy to attain to the out resurrection. I like to be resurrected as an overcomer is I pass away before You come back.

Maye 400 students are graduating from a high school. But the principal may say we have some rewards for the special graduates. They graduate with honours. They not only passed, they had the highest grades all the time. We want to honour them. That would be an 'out' graduation. It was outstanding, an honour. That was Paul's goal. He knew, going through all this in his life.

Same note, to arrive at the out resurrection indicates our entire being has been gradually and continually been resurrected. I hope this becomes part of your personal prayer contact with the Lord. Have this in your heart. Lord, thank you for saving me, bringing me into the recovery, thank you for preserving me until now. Lord I pray to attain to the out resurrection. Please give me the experiences I need to attain to the out resurrection. This is God's way, gradually and continually.

Our personal life should have a goal. Paul said one thing in two different ways. Acts 20, meeting elders from Ephesus. He said, I'm not trying to save my soul life, what's on my heart is I would finish the course that the Lord has arranged. Every one of us has a personal journey. We want to finish the course. To complete our part of the journey. 2 Tim. 4  Paul said, I kept the faith, I fought the good fight, I finished the course. If anyone of us, according to God's sovereign arrangement and will, would not be a living overcomer because of age, then we hope that we would all finish our course in victory and have entered into the readiness for the out resurrection. THs should be our goal. Brother, keep running, finish the course. That's why I love Micah 7, and the prophet says do not boast against me mine enemy, for when I fall I will rise again, and when I am in darkness Jehovah enlightens me. I don't believe I'm the only one who has fallen down. But we have the power of resurrection life in us. We can tell the enemy, don't boast against me. When I fall I will rise again. Because the power of resurrection life that resurrected Christ is in me and death will not win.

What are we doing when we're living in the resurrection life of Christ? Gradual inward resurrection of our inward being. The more we experience this personally in our secret hidden life with the Lord, the more we live in the resurrection life of Christ personally and corporately. Then we will be in the reality of the Body of Christ.

## I. The church as the Body of Christ is an organism absolutely in the resurrection life of Christ.

Nothing natural does the Body life allow. That's a kind of Body principle. The Body only accepts resurrection life. This is the Body of Christ as an organism. A local church is a local expression of the organic Body of Christ and the local churches are the procedure to be brought into the blending of the Body of Christ. So, the situation is, when someone comes into the church life, we were saved, pursuing the truth, knowing the way of life, living an actual and practical church life. In the 60s we thought we had arrived. We had arrived at the procedure. What should be happening in the lives of the saints while they are living and practising the church life. They are brought into the reality of the Body of Christ by experiencing the resurrection life of Christ.

Only those in the out resurrection will be rapture ready. Personally we should seek the Lord. We are here loving the Lord and caring for the saints. The Lord must have the reality of the Body of Christ expressed in local churches throughout the earth.

## II. In order to be in the reality of the Body of Christ, we need to live in the resurrection life of Christ

All the time. The time we were born, we have been living in the human realm. Living by the human life. Now we need to live in the resurrection life of Christ.

- reality of resurrection is Christ as the life giving Spirit.

He breathed and said receive the Holy Spirit.

- when we live in the divine life we are in resurrection

In my daily life, sixteen hours of being awake and alert. Maybe I would wonder, all day long, how much time did I live in the divine life in resurrection? How much of the time did I live in my natural life? If we have a failure because of a weakness, right away we know. Our conscience condemns us, we know we have to repent. But we may live for hours in the natural life and have no idea. This is just the way I always lived. My conscience doesn't condemn me. I was nice. I wasn't mean. But I was naturally mean. I was not rude, I was polite. Because I'm kind of a polite person most of the time. I was patient. We need the light to shine to know by what life am I living? When I'm enjoying my breakfast, praying with my wife, it is very human. Is there any resurrection life there? I can sense, it's with her. She's been with the Lord, and the prayer indicates this. We need to look to the Lord, not examine ourselves.

- anything done in natural life in not the reality of the body of Christ

Even in the church life we may do many things. Some saints are Marthas, so able and practical in many aspects of church service. But, it's natural. Are we aware of that? Do we realise that? If we are aware and realise, we don't rebuke the saints. We don't withdraw from service. But we need some prayer and fellowship. This would be part of our overseeing. If we ourselves have no burden or concern for this.

## III. Resurrection is an eternal principle in our service to God

- that which passes through death and still remains is resurrection
- something that has come out of death

This applies. There's no doubt we all love our wives or we wouldn't have married them. We passed through many things. WE can still embrace them and say I love you. But we have a command in Eph. 5, love your wives as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her. To die inwardly for the sake of my wife's being healed, being encouraged, being covered. So eventually the love is no longer natural, resurrection love, God-man love. Still affectionate, still endearing, but beyond the natural realm.

## IV. In order the live in the resurrection life of Christ, we must know, experience, and gain the God of resurrection

2 Cor. 1:3

> blessed be the God and father of our lord Jesus Christ, the father of compassions and god of all comfort
>
> Who comforts us in all our affliction that we may be able to comfort those in every affliction through the comforting through which we ourselves are comforted through God
>
> for even as the suffering abound so also the comforting abound. For whether we are afflicted it is for your.. or whether we are comforted it is for your comforting which operates ...
>
> our hope for you is firm, knowing that you are partakers of the suffering so also of the comfort
>
> for we wan you not to be ignorant brothers of ours affliction which befell us in Asia that we were excessively burdened beyond our power so we despaired even of living
>
> even we ourselves had the response of death in ourselves that we should not have confidence in ourselves but on god who raises the dead

How could Paul speak on behalf of the God of all comfort? How could He know the God of all comfort? And how could he minister this comfort? 8-9 Paul excessively burdened, beyond his power, despaired. In his self was the response of death. They were asking the Lord, what will this situation result in? The answer inwardly was death, Paul. Why? So that, and now we, should not base our confidence on ourselves but in God. God who raises the dead. This is knowing, experiencing and gaining, not only the resurrection life, but the God of resurrection. At least in every country there needs to be at least one brother, not excluding the sisters, like with ME Barber, could just be in China.

- God working through cross to terminate us that we would not trust in ourselves

We should not fear this. Rather we should fear being untouched and unbroken our whole life, to be natural to the end. 

- His life and nature wrought into us

Positively working.

- killing of cross results in manifestation of resurrection life

> who delivered us out of so great and a death and will deliver us, in whom we have hoped he yet will deliver us .. our boasting is this, the testimony of our conscience, in singleness and sincerity of God, not in fleshly wisdom, in the grace of god we have conducted ourselves in the world and more abundantly toward you.

We have conducted ourselves in the singleness of God, the sincerity of God, the grace of God. It is a serious matter to do any matter int he church life fleshly wisdom. A brother may have education in MBA. Qualified. You are qualified for the cross. God created you with an ability. Let is pass through death and into resurrection. Fleshly wisdom, trusting our intelligence, trusting our experience. There needs to be visible patterns in the churches everywhere. No-one wears a sign saying, I'm deporting myself in the sincerity of God. That opens the way for others to take the same journey.

> If anyone serves me let Him follow me 

By being a seed, falling into the ground for the release of the life within us.

> And where I am , there also my servant will be. If anyone serves me, the father will honour him.

We serve Him by following Him. Follow Him as the seed, a life-releasing death. We cannot participate in Christ's redemptive death. But we can be one with Him in experiencing His life-releasing death, because we are all the grains of wheat. Sister Barber was a seed that fell into the earth in China and life was released. Brother Nee, those 20 years, following the Lord into the ground. Experiencing the life releasing death of Christ.

The power of Christ's resurrection enables us to be willing to be conformed. But the experience of the mould brings us to the power of Christ's resurrection. He experienced one level of the power of Christ's resurrection when he was learning to be conformed to Christ's death, but after experiencing that he is touch something beyond anything before. The surpassing greatness. Death is the second strongest thing in the universe next go God's life. Nothing can defeat. The power of resurrection enables us to be confirmed in the mould, being in the mould brings us into a deeper experience of Christ's resurrection.

- natural strength and ability need to be dealt with by the cross to become useful.

We may not know what is our natural strength and ability but others will know. Ask your wife. If you can withstand that. She can say, yes, you're this. You have a very strong will. But, we're learning. It has to be dealt with by the cross.

- budding rod

Fruit bearing is the sign of resurrection. The manifestation of resurrection life. Those in the leadership feed God's people. Effortlessly. That's what they are.

## V. If we live by the resurrection life of Christ for the reality of the Body of Christ, we will be steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that our labour is not in vain in the Lord

Don't believe the lie of the enemy to give up. 

The Lord remembers our service. The Lord remembers our labour of love. When He comes He will reward us, with what we hope to be the out-resurrection. Let none of use give up. WE are not here in vain. We all are learning to serve, to labour in the resurrection life of Christ. We are not where we were five years ago. It is developing. The more it develops the more we will realise our labour will not be in vain. Look at Paul, all Asia forsook him. Even Demas abandoned him. But Paul was in this reality. My labour was in resurrection and it's not in vain. That will be made clear when the Lord comes back. The Lord said in Revelation, I'm coming with my reward for every man according to his work.
