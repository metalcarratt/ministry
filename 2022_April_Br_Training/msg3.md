# Message Three - Living in the reality of the Body of Christ through the experience of the cross

The will of God is focused on Christ and the church. In God's economy God as one person, one goal and one way. The one person in the All-inclusive Christ. The goal is to build the Church. The church is the organic Body of Christ, the One New Man. Ultimately the New Jerusalem. The way is the cross. One person, one goal, one way. I would expect whenever we speak concerning the cross in a weighty way the saints are frightened or uneasy. The self in us is the source of fear. But if we have a clear vision of the cross we will be fully at rest. God's way to solve all problems is the cross. When the Lord Jesus dies on the cross, we may say He died an all-inclusive death. On the negative side He terminated sins, sin, the world, Satan himself. He also released the divine life within Him. If someone could say I know the answer to all problems in your family life, married life, church life, Christian life. We need to begin to have this view of the cross. It's God way of solving all problems.

Let's be more specific. How does the cross solve all problems? It is by terminating them. In the human realm, how do people try to solve problems? By negotiation. Often by compromise. You give in a little, I give in a little and somehow we come together in the middle and go on together okay. That's diplomacy. That's politics. The other way is to go to war. Well, in a sense, God also went to war. But the warfare accomplished on the cross, followed by resurrection. Just recently I had a fresh and encouraging experience that the cross solves the problems in my fallen being. Once the cross is applied, that's it. It's not us trying to say, Lord give me another chance. I'll try harder, I'll improve. We all know that is just a waste of time. But the cross solves all problems by terminating.

If we have any problem we bring it to God in prayer with the realisation that God's way to solve this problem is the cross. I first need the cross to be applied to me. Anything in me that would make it complicated. I don't want to make things worse by doing things my way according to my disposition.

Not just through the cross, through the experience of the cross. Let's say we had a rigorous training and one brother asked several brothers what experiences of the cross have you had. It doesn't mean you open up and share all kinds of things, but is there anything you can share concerning your experience of the cross. I believe many of us would have something to say. We live in the reality of the Body of Christ *through* the experience of the cross.

## I. The Body of Christ is the corporate Christ, the Body-Christ

1 Cor. 12, So also is the Christ. The church can rightly be called the Body-Christ.

What you do to the members of the Body you do to Christ. Paul began his journey with this glorious revelation - the enthroned Christ and the Body-Christ. He asked, who are You, Lord. He said I am Jesus, whom you persecute. Then he asked, what should I do Lord? The Lord did not tell him directly. He said arise, go into the city and it will be told to you what to do. The Lord sent to him Ananias. This was his first taste of the Body life. The All-inclusive Christ producing the corporate Christ.

## II. The Body is versus the self; the enemy of the Body is the self

If we were to ask one another or other saints, what is the enemy of the Body of Christ. Probably everyone would say, well that's Satan. Well, that's not wrong. He surely is the enemy. But that is a kind of outward, objective and somewhat distant enemy. We need a vision to see the enemy of the Body is the self. When Peter was rebuking the Lord, the Lord told him, Get behind Me, Satan. Where was Satan? In Peter. Where in Peter? In the self. That self was the expression of the mind of Satan in that instance. Don't let this happen to you. Then the Lord talked about denying the self, taking up the cross, being willing to lose our soul life to follow Him.

It's likely most of us have been in meetings, whether for prayer or prophesying or fellowship. And we just realise this person's prayer was the self. And we personally could not say Amen. If someone stands up to speak, not in the flow, not on the subject, rambling along, until a brother might respectfully say, please bring your speaking to an end. That's the self. That's the Body verses the self. The self is versus the Body. We are either living in one or the other. There's no middle ground.

- independent of God

If anyone is independent, that's the self. A principle of the Body is dependence in life, mutual dependence.

- the Satanic mind; the Satanic thought

This is a powerful revelation. In the book, The Heavenly Visions, there is a message on, The Vision of the Self. 

- hinderance to seeing and practicing the Body

Surely we all want to go on. We have some sense, there are hinderances. Lord, remove them. The Lord may indicate, I will, but first I need to make them known to you. Because some of the hinderances are in you. One of the hinderances is you, meaning the self.

I have found it quite challenging to give messages to middle aged and older brothers. They will say they know it. They've read it and heard about it. But that is a doctrinal knowing. "I know it, therefore I have. I know it, therefore I am it. I know it therefore I'm experiencing it." We have to be careful because the self hinders us from the vision and from practicing the Body.

How long will this go on? Here and there and everywhere the self is hindering us. Who's open for the self to be terminated through the cross?

The self is the real division, the real sect.

One can have the self and say sincerely, I have the church life. But this is someone in the church, but not in the Body. The self and the church life can coexist for a time.

If I go for a doctor's examination and the doctor is there and say I have all the results and he says you have a large tumour. It may or not be cancerous. Of course that will be a shock to any of use. Then he will say, based on the information I have, it's more likely not cancer but I don't know. For this kind of tumour the answer is surgery. And I say yes to the solution. I hate having this tumour. There's a way to take care of this? And that is to terminate the tumour and remove it from the body and then the body heals itself. If we really know what the self is, we will condemn it, deny it, reject it, renounce it. This is our cooperation with the cross.

- blending requires the self to be crossed out

1 Cor 12, the Lord is blending the Body together. Blending is the way into the reality of the Body, provided we are taking the way of the cross. The cross makes blending possible.

- if we deny ourselves the life we live will be the Body life

The Body life does not stop and start. Consider your human body. It's not just sometimes. The Body life is non-stop. If we are fully living in the Body the Lord will finally gain the expression of His Body.

## III. We need to see a vision of the cross and understand the significance of the cross

Thank You Lord, You have a way to deal with this problem solving cross in me.

- one person, Christ, and one way, the cross
- the cross is the center of God's government
- the cross is not to suffer but to terminate

It's not that there isn't any suffering, but the primary meaning isn't suffering. The primary meaning is termination. If there is no termination, the suffering can make the self stronger. I'm a survivor. I'm a tough guy. I never backed away from a fight. I'm gonna get through this. So the Lord removes His hand, you say, see, I got through. There was some suffering but a strong element was activated in that person to survive. But when there is the cross, there is a termination.

- need the cross to progress spiritually and have a proper church life

Lord, by the end of this year I really want to have progressed. I don't want to waste the next eight plus months. I really pray for the progress spiritually. 

What is a proper church life? Before covid we came together on the LD meeting, a few dozen saints were there. In the next 20 minutes saints came in gradually. Is that proper? This is the Lord's Table. The Lord's Table. If you were invited to dinner with the president or prime minister of your country, would you be late? The talk, the gossip among many saints is not proper. The over functioning or under functioning of some is not proper. We want to be proper according to God, not according to human opinion. Experience the cross.

- altar at the center of God's building

To understand this need to read Ezekiel 43:13-27. In this vision of the rebuilding o God's dwelling place, there's the center of God's building and we all have to pass through the center to be in God's dwelling place. The cross is a particular way, when we come to the altar. Before a LD meeting several years ago at the front row, there were two brothers. One was at the corner of two rows. They kept praying again and again. I never heard this kind of praying before. Going back and forth. There was anger in the praying. And my whole being was open to be in the Lord's table meeting. I couldn't bear it. I just, in a respectful way, walked over to one of the elders and said, brother, I have to go. And then later that day I received more than one phone call. How, before that LD meeting a husband and wife had a vicious argument. Full of anger. Then he comes to the LT meeting as if nothing is wrong. No dealing. That's improper. No cross. There was a situation in one church, the elders were meeting prior and one of them lost their temper. Right after that meeting he went upstairs and began to function as if nothing was wrong. Eventually that brother called and asked did you leave because of me. The Lord in His mercy cleared it up. It's just an instance. I want to take it seriously. What does it mean? Before I come to the meeting I need to repent. This is the cross applied in a very basic way.

- eventually brough to the point where we touch the cross in a definite way

## IV. The cross leads us to the Body, consummates with the Body, and operates within the sphere of the Body

All of God’s dealings with us have been with a view to prepare us for the Body; all of His work in us is a process of elimination so that we can become functioning members of the Body.
