# Message Six - Reaching Zion by Praying

Zion is the high peak of the divine revelation - that God in Christ became man, to make man in Christ God in life and nature but not in the Godhead. This is the high peak of the divine revelation and reaching it requires the reality of the Body of Christ. Zion typifies the overcomers who are becoming the reality of the Body of Christ.

'Reaching'. The Lord sometimes took his disciples up the mountain. They must have at least walked up there. In Revelation John was carried away to a great and high mountain. But for us in this message, reaching is a matter outwardly of climbing, inwardly really being constituted with the processed and consummated Triune God to live a Godman life. The more we live the Godman life the more we are climbing upward.

Several years ago I go a clever email from some younger brother that visited Jerusalem. They were quite clever because they heard of Zion in the midst of Jerusalem. They were saying, we were there and it wasn't that high. They thought this means it's so easy to go up there. I said I don't geological theology. It's quite a journey to reaching Mount Zion. 

Among the Old Testament types is the Holy City Jerusalem, and within this city a high peak, Zion. On Zion, the temple was built. Jerusalem typifies the church and Mount Zion typifies the overcomers in the church. In Revelation 14, the 144,000 overcomers were raptured to Zion. That is Zion in the heavens. So the book of Revelation shows us, the Lord want to build up Zion. Now, here is an important point, from Practical Points Concerning Blending. The overcomers are not a separate group within the church life. They are just ordinary brothers and sisters, but inwardly in their inner being they are in the reality of the Body of Christ. It's on Mount Zion that the building takes place. 

The only way to reach Zion is praying. The only way. That is why the title of this message is reaching Zion by praying. But we are not just coming directly into this kind of praying. What we mean by Zion. The reality of the Body of Christ. This is what we're trying to reach. Otherwise we're praying without a clear vision of where we're trying to go.

## I. The Lord's recovery is to build up Zion - the reality of the Body of Christ consummating in the New Jerusalem

### A. highest peak - reality of the Body of Christ

This is our goal. We all began in Jerusalem, and we're still here, in the church. Now we're learning that within the church and through the church as the procedure, the Lord wants to bring us to Zion, into the reality of the Body of Christ. This is something that is built up.

- an organism - the issue of the mingling of God and man

What is the goal, the issue of God becoming man and man becoming God. Why does God want to make us the same as He is? Why not just take the easy way of so many gospel preachers?

- the enlargement of the first Godman.

- highest peak is to produce an organic Body.

In 1994-1997 brother Lee ministered to us knowing that we were on a much lower level at that time. He was alone on the peak, although I kind of believe his counterpart sister Lee was with him. There can be a certain loneliness in the ministry of the Word. Just by the Lord's arrangement you are aware and in something so real to you that is not yet real to very many others yet. But your burden is to help them reach the same point. 

### B. Reality of the Body of Christ - union and mingling of God with man to live out a corporate God-man

This is the most helpful ministry material. What is the reality of the Body of Christ? Let's carefully go through this

The living of a corporate God-man.
