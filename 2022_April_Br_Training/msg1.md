# General Subject - The Christian Life, the Church Life, and the Body Life

We are all here because of the Lord's mercy and grace, forbearance and long suffering, love and faithfulness for all of us. Before the foundation of the world God chose us to be holy, predestined us to be holy. In a certain place we were born and grew up. At a time ordained by the Lord we became believers, we were baptised, we were saved. The Lord led us further. The Lord's recovery and the church life. The Lord put in us a love for life and truth. Our Lord is very active. He is the Sherpherd of our souls, the King of kings and Lord of lords. He is interceeding for us and caring for us. If God is for us, who can be against us. God is for us. So we are having these meetings under such a wonderful process and consummated Triune God being dispensed into us. There is only one unique source, God the Father. Of course, I'm still learning, to seek Him, to wait on Him. What should be the general subject?

The general subject - the Christian life, the Church life, and the Body life. Simple words. I want to establish something in the beginning. The Christian life, church life and body life are distinct but not separate. They are interdependent, inter-related. We cannot fully have any one of the three without the others.

The Christian life - our personal, secret, hidden life, in Christ, before our Father in the heavens. Matt. 6. If we do not have a hidden life, of one on one, increasingly deep and transparent fellowship, we will not reach maturity in our lifetime. Nothing can replace our one on one personal life relationship with the Lord. Here we can open our whole being to Him and He is free to touch particular matters in us that He wants to deal with, not openly but personally.

The Church life - based on the personal life. Walking according to the Spirit. Christ making His home in our hearts. Eventually we will realise we cannot live the church life alone, we need all the saints. We are in another realm. We're in the practicality of the kingdom of God. The more I am functioning in the church life in a genuine and practical way, the more my personal life is uplifted. The more my personal life is developed the richer my church life is. A number of dear saints stop at this station, thinking they have arrived.

The Body life - the local churches are not the goal. Organic and in reality. What is the Body life? What does it mean to live, together, the Body life? Again, as the Lord shows us the Body life, our church life, our Christian life, is uplifted.

# Message One - Practicing the Church Life under the Unique Headship of Christ

The unique headship of Christ. We read verse in Ephesians. That Christ is the head over all things to the church. We appreciate and believe this. But how does this work out in our Christian life, church life and Body life? There's a word I want to pay attention to. 'The order of the church comes out of the authority in the church." What kind of authority is in the local church where you are? Is there authority in the church? Surely there is. That word authority is connected with headship, the honouring of the unique headship of Christ. 

Burden - words from the book Authority and Submission.

> we must be a person who submits to authority before we can be a deputy authority ourselves. 

We must be this kind of person who recognises and submits to authority. Then we can be a deputy authority

> all deputy authorities must remember they are merely God's representative authorities. They have no authority in themselves.

Zero. None of the apostles in the NT had authority in themselves. Br Lee and Nee knew this. But they were truly representative authorities

> absolutely no authority in ourselves.

Throughout the decades I've been confronted by brothers who truly believed they were the authority. One brother said, "This is my work, the church you are in. Only what I say matters." This needs to be settled in our being. That we have absolutely no authority in ourselves.

> you have to realise that you have no authority in yourself.

Do you realise that you have no authority in yourself? We can't realise this for someone else. I just thank the Lord for His mercy that I realise this. The fact I'm a co-worker doesn't give me authority. The fact I'm in the ministry of the Word doesn't give me authority.

> God's deputy authority must deny himself.

> Fellowship is a basic qualification for being an authority.

Fellowship. A brother may say, I fulfil this one. To what extent? Only with those of the same generation as you? Fellowship is the flow of life throughout the whole body. Paul's first fellowship was not with the Apostle Peter but with Ananias, who had real authority. He told Paul to be baptised, calling on the Lord.

> Those who are God's deputy authorities must have a constant and intimate fellowship with the Lord.

The elders and leading brothers really are deputy authorities. But all such brothers must have a constant fellowship.

> It is a most ugly thing for anyone to speak for his authority in order to establish authority himself. No one can establish his own authority.

This has happened. Some regarded themselves as authority.

> All self established authorities must be eradicated from among us.

This may become the prayer of some of the brothers. Just eradicate any self established authority where we are. All over the earth.

> No-one can establish his own authority. You must allow God to establish every authority and we must not try to build up any authority.

> Those who find out what others says about them and then get angry, indignant, or vindictive, are not qualified to be a deputy authority.

> Those who vindicate themselves have no authority whatsoever.

This is a test.

> The more a person think he is in authority the less it is likely he is in authority.

> A deputy authority must not act according to his own feeling are care for himself or be a self-? person.

I have acted many times according to my own feeling. It is one thing to do this in your married life or family life. But to do this in the church life, body life, ministry, I just have a feeling. I remember one brother, sincere, describing a situation, that's how I feel. As if that's the decisive matter.

> The main thing about a representative authority is that he represents God.

Have you ever, in your entire life, been in a meeting or in a group, or personal fellowship, or receiving a message, that you had the sense, I just contacted someone representing God? I believe this way and those who live contrary, it will be brought forth on that day. The Lord will be able to say, you learned, you allowed me to train you. Now I want you to reign with me for a thousand years. All of us are fallen human beings. The Lord gained Paul, brother Lee, brother Nee. The same Lord can and will gain all of us.

> A deputy authority is one who represents authority, not one who exercises authority.

If someone is representing authority, he's not conscious of it. You're like a cowboy in the old west, have a star pinned to you, I'm a deputy. We're not aware of it.

The Lord is the Head. The church life, is a being headed up life. Personally and corporately.

## I. The unique headship of Christ is closely related to the constitution of the church - the way in which the church is formed and arranged.

- church constituted absolutely with Christ as life and unique Head.

In NZ every local church should be constituted absolutely with Christ as life and Christ as the unique Head. When we visit places we are not there to spy or examine. We are just there. We just sense the atmosphere is pleasant because here life is flowing. The headship is clearly honoured. It's in the atmosphere.

- organisation cannot be found in the NT; hierarchy is an insult

The saints will appreciate the function of the speaking brothers but not uplift them. We had to learn this of brother Lee. He was a rare person. But it was so clear in his being, he's a brother, no hierarchy. We may want to ask the Lord. Is there any hierarchy?

- no unique definite official or permanent leadership

In some places, even among the elders they have this thought, who is the leading elder? We are all the same in our nature. 

- principle of eldership is plurality; no definite leader

- never take someone else as an intermediary between us and the Lord

## II. The order of the church comes out of the authority in the church - the honouring of the unique headship of Christ

- no organisation but spiritual order

If we were to ask the saints, what is the authority in the church where you are? 

- need to submit to have real church life

The "real practice of the church life" - only by submitting to the unique headship of Christ.

- headship being realised in a practical way

what is the reality of the church? one aspect is Christ expressed through everyone because Christ is the head of everyone.

## III. The church life is a life of being headed up under the unique headship of Christ

- God heading up His chosen ones to be the Body of Christ
- In the proper church life we are being headed up in Christ

When are children are growing we are encouraged. We don't expect them to be an adult, but they are grow-ing. What is disappointing is not that this local church is not headed up. What is disappointing is there is not heading up taking place, or there is counterfeit heading because "this" brother thinks he's the man. 

- if we do not know what is is to be headed up in Christ, we cannot know the church.

The church is the local expression of the headed up body of Christ. We either are that, or we're not.

- taking the lead to be headed up

we are being perfected in a particular way, with a particular function.
