General Subject - The Christian Life, the Church Life, and the Body Life

# Message One - Practicing the Church Life under the Unique Headship of Christ

WE are all here because of the Lord's mercy and grace, forbearance and long suffering, love and faithfulness for all of us. Before the foundation of the world God chose us to be holy, predestined us to be holy. In a certain place we were born and grew up. At a time ordained by the Lord we became believers, we were baptised, we were saved. The Lord led us further. The Lord's recovery and the church life. The Lord put in us a love for life and truth. Our Lord is very active. He is the Sherpherd of our souls, the King of kings and Lord of lords. He is interceeding for us and caring for us. If God is for us, who can be against us. God is for us. So we are having these meetings under such a wonderful process and consummated Triune God being dispensed into us. There is only one unique source, God the Father. Of course, I'm still learning, to seek Him, to wait on Him. What should be the general subject?
