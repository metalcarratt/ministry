# Message 6 - Christ as the Word of God

what is the bible? the autobiography and history of the journeying triune god as the word of God.

the bible is a divine romance. the bachelor God wants to become the married god.
the bachelor God became the creating god. the creating god became the incarnated god. next he became the redeeming god. then he entered into resurrection to become the compounded god as the life giving spirit. next is the intensified god. the indwelling god. finally the incorporated god.

## I. Christ is the word of god - the definition, explanation, and expression of God.

he is the I am. 

Micah 4:2 his goings forth are from the days of eternity. he was going forth in his incarnation, in his human living, in his crucifixion, in his resurrection, in his coming into our being. he is going forth into the parts of our soul.

### c. five events in john 1 - the creator (creation), the tabernacler (incarnation), the lamb (crucifixion), the anointing spirit (transformation), the ladder joining earth to heaven (building)

every time we come to the word "Lord I come to you in your holy Word." the logos must be converted to rhema, the instant, applied word, the word "with your name on it."

## ii. the word of god speaks through creation

when god first talked to job he asked him about the animals. can you explain why the crocodile is afraid of the hippo? why the horse charges fearlessly into battle. after god spoke all these things job said I am nothing.

man is without excuse because creation proves their is god.

- the **abundance of light** in the universe shows that light is a divine characteristic
- the **greatness** of the universe manifests the greatness of god
- the **wonder** of the universe manifest how wonderful god is. this means he is incomprehensible
- the **beauty** of the universe manifest gods beauty
- gods arrangement and preparation for man and his every needs shows his lovinging kindness toward man.

the spirit, the word and light were the instruments god used to create light. the spirit of god was brooding. and god said, Let there be light. christ as the spirit, the reality of God. brooding over the waters of death to generate life. christ as the word is the speaking of god. christ as the light is the shining of god.
