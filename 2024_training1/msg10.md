# Message 10 - Glory and Glorification as revealed in the gospel of John

When we turn our heart to the Lord the veil is taken away. We all with unveiled face, beholding and reflectin like a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same
image, from glory to glory. Is this part of your daily life? You turn your heart and have the realisation another Person is living in you? Not just a spirit or an element, but a
Person? Christ is on the throne and also in us. It is touching and supplying when we turn to the Lord and behold the indwelling Christ and touch the glory in His face.

## II. glory is related to the economy of God

### C. man created to express Him
More and more there will be less self expression and more God expression

### D. To sin is to fall short of the glory of God
Sin is falling short of God's glory. Even if you are kind, nice, patient. But if there is no God's glory, it is sin.

### J. 
The church is not for *our* glory but for the corporate glory of God

### M.
Are you clear you are God in life and nature? It's clear, humanly, that you are like your human father.

## IV. glory involved in the Lord's process and His being the lamp in the NJ
### C.
"did not receive glory from ne" - did not receive. Our inner being is closed to it, even if someone wants to glory us. We love one another, but we will not receive glory from any
source. If we receive it it means in our being we want to be glorified. We won't take it in. We seek *His* glory.

### G. Enter into the highest stage of glory
#### 1.
In every meeting, n the praryer meeting, prophecying meeting, LT meeting, the corporate expression of God. "the glory which you gave to Me" - in the Godhead, "I have given to them" what a gift, "that
they may be one, even as we are one." I don't have a full understanding of that kind of oneness. That the onenss among us will be the same degree and level of the Father and the Son. This is the
believer's deepest oneness. Among little vital praying ompanions, that they would pray for this highest level of oneness. When we realise this is crucial to the uttermost and will require the Lord
to have access to any part of our being that could present us from having this kind of oneness. We all have a responsibility in every chruch meeting. A learning spirit - the Lord shows what is the deepest
oneness in the divine glory. To be the same in any nation, any language, any culture on the earth.

#### 2.
Need to pass through the third stage to know the body - the cross applied to the flesh, the self, the natural man. Come to the Lord and shine in me, to know where I am, and what I need in order to
mature in life. The Lord desires that hundres, thousands, of saints, would reach this stage long before the end. Then they can shepherd others.

## V.
How often do you pray to the Father? How much fellowship do you have with the Father? "Our fellowship is with the Father, and with His Son, Jesus Christ." Our Father is the source of every
positive thing in the church life. Any basic important decision you make, come to the source, come to the Father.
