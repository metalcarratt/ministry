# Message One:
# - Christ as the Great Light,
# - the One who has authority,
# - the Physician,
# - the Bridegroom,
# - the unfulled cloth,
# - and the new wine

## I. great light
The light shines in the darkness and the darkness did not overcome it. Become sons of light. My Father is light. You were once darkness but are now light. The saints in the light. Light is the presence of God.
The God who said out of darkness light shall shine. Gen 1 is a picture of our inner being. "darkness on the face of the deep" "God said, let there be light."

A. because of the merciful compassions of God, the rising sun. Be full of compassion. Jeremiah contacted God as the compassionate One every morning.

B. healing in His wings (rays). His shining in us is for the growth in life in the dispelling of the darkness and anulling any unrighteousness in our being.

E. the light of dawn (the fresh rising of the sun); brighter and brighter

F. the righteous will shine forth.
Become exactly the same as God in expression.

## II. One who has authority, a man under authority.
The reason the centurion had authority was because he was under authority.

When man was created all things were under his authority because he was under God's authority. The animals in the millennial kingdom won't harm people because the earth will once again
be under the authority one ones (the overcomers) who will also be under authority (God's).

## III. Physician
In the church life we don't want to portray the Lord us a judge to people but as a physician. The Lord healed, enlivened and saved the sick people.

D. Luke 18:9, the pharisee prayed to himself

F. Moses cried out to Jehovah and Jehovah showed him a tree

## IV. Bridegroom

C. The Spirit is on an errand to beautify us with the riches of Christ.

## V. Unfulled cloth, our new garment

F. When we pray not to lose our temper but lose itmore beause we tried to put the unfulled cloth on our natural life.

## VI. our new wine

B. 1. the exciting life
