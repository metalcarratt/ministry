# Message Two - Christ as:
# - the One with the heavenly-ruled deeds, 
# - our shepherd, 
# - our rest, 
# - and the sower

- Healing -> believe and touch
- Shepherding -> experience and enjoy
- Resting -> come and take
- Growing -> condition and supply (not just God supplying us but we supplying Christ)

^^ This is the gospel for us.

## I. heavenly ruled deeds
Matt 9:20-22, the woman who had a flow of blood for 12 years.

**A.** garment - righteous deeds; fringe - heavenly ruling

The Lord didn't feel the touch of the large crowd thronging around Him, but He felt that one touch.

"If only I can touch..." - there was this faith.

**2.** under the ruling, governing, and binding of the heavenly government, limitation and regulation

**C.** humanity. in this case the healing power is the Lord's human virtue. All our problems are human. We are singul, defiled, wild, unregulated.
Our whole life is a life of bleeding. You cannot control the ebbing of life. Born to die, with no hope.

**E.** divine power. The power is ready, waiting for a sinner's touch. A sinner with faith.

Even after we becoe a Christian we still need to be healed. So many things Satan uses to keep the blood flowing, on the pathway to death.

**F.** God become touchable. So many young people are hemorrhaging everywhere. They need the humanity of Christ.

## II. shepherd

Matt. 9:36, "like a sheep not having a shepherd"

Five statuses:

**A.** initial stage - pasture, waters - eating and drinking

**B.** second stage - paths of righteousness - restores my soul, guides me on the paths of righteousness. The real restoration of the soul is the soul's being transformed.

**C.** third stage - the valley of the shadow of death - in the shadow of death we know His deeper shepherding. protecting us and instructing us. seems there is no light at the end of the tunnel. guide and lead us.
His rod and his staff, they comfort me. only a person who has passed through death would enjoy the rod and staff as comfort to us.

**D.** fourth stage

**1.** spreads a table. Not just a pasture but a table, and right in front of the enemy. A table of victory. A table that declares, it is done. Christ is Victor! In the presence of our adversaries - shepherds
us in the fight against the enemies. A declaration of victory.

**2.** anoints our head with oil - the Spirit - our cup runs over - the Father

**E.** fifth stage. in the house of Jehovah

**2.** dwell in the house of God all the days of our life. If you leave this place you leave His face. You don't want to leave His face.

**a.** behold the beauty

**b.** inquire about everything. the tiniest thing.

**c.** God's shelter, hide ourselves, God's tent - the church life today

**d.** our head lifted up by God

"never leave this place. if you leave this place you will lose your protection."

## III. rest

**A.** come to me all who toil and are burdened

All the people in the world are enslaved.

**B.** take my yoke upon you.

## IV. sower

Proper condition and supply for the seed to grow.
