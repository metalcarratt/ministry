# message 7 - the bread of life

consider our actual situation. how much are we in these things? "I am concerned that
you may not have very much enjoyment of christ." if we have never been in ecstasy
before God, we have not had sufficient enjoyment of christ. this is the jubilee.
free from anxiety, free, exalted. when you have the words of grace you can be in
the jubilee anywhere.

what does it mean for the lord to be the bread of life? twice the lord says, "I am
the bread of life."

but what about our taste? our hunger? are we eating sufficiently? this also gives
rise to the question of digestion and assimilation. we need to learn to eat this bread
of life. expression and constitution. don't allow the Egyptian food to come in. what is
the nature of our diet? what do we spend time eating? inwardly exercise our spirit to
taste the lord.
