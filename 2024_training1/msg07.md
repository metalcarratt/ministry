# message 7 - the bread of life

consider our actual situation. how much are we in these things? "I am concerned that
you may not have very much enjoyment of christ." if we have never been in ecstasy
before God, we have not had sufficient enjoyment of christ. this is the jubilee.
free from anxiety, free, exalted. when you have the words of grace you can be in
the jubilee anywhere.

what does it mean for the lord to be the bread of life? twice the lord says, "I am
the bread of life."

but what about our taste? our hunger? are we eating sufficiently? this also gives
rise to the question of digestion and assimilation. we need to learn to eat this bread
of life. expression and constitution. don't allow the Egyptian food to come in. what is
the nature of our diet? what do we spend time eating? inwardly exercise our spirit to
taste the lord.

## I 7 crucial points

RV has outline for each book. Processed. Small enough to eat. Begins with incarnation.
Bread came down out of heaven. Giving His flesh and blood indicates crucifixion. The 
mutual abiding is through eating. Eating - to take something outside of us into our being
and to ingest it. Because He lives in us we live because of Him. How much do we aspire, seek
Jehovah, to find His words and eat them?

## II.

eaten and digested it becomes our constitution. We need a good digestion of the bread
of life. The test comes in our daily life. Eating the Lord is a daily matter. If we're
not eating we're not healthy. To enter into digestion and assimilation requires dealing
with the Lord. Develop the practice of spending time with the Lord. WE need to take these
words in and deal with the Lord. "Ask and it will be given to you". Lord, bring me into
a much higher enjoyment of you. Bring me into the experience, into the enjoyment.

## III.

The matter of taste is a crucial thing. Lord, forgive me for so much wasted time. Redeem
the time. Spending the time, devoting the time to really digest the Lord. Take care of this
kind of daily habit. The Lord has done everything on His part, we need to exercise our spirit,
not to read things in a doctrinal way, but by exercising our spirit. We so much laor for the
food that perishes. The Lord has called everyone of us into a different kind of enterpirse.

### C "the true bread"

there are many other things to eat, which are poisonous, which can damage us. Satan is not only
interested in causing us to sin, but in affecting our diet. Giving us a taste for negative
things, even evil things. A major part of his strategy today is to affect our taste. There is
a controlling facotr in the LR, which is a taste for life. Here there is a possibility to develop
a taste of life. The enemy realises this, so he devises a strategy to affect our taste. The
taste will influence what kind of diet you have. The enemy is acting in a very subtle way,
through the internet and social media, to influence our taste.


"only spiritual things are real" - How will the Lord ever get His expression on earth if there
are no men eating Him?

### E.

Receive by faith all that He did

### G. "It is written"

The Lord stands on the ground of the word to deal with the enemy. May we learn to employ the word
through eating the word to deal with the enemy. The implication is that the Lord was living
by the word.

Eating and digestion. By digestion what we eat is assimilated into our being. "to take in and
incorporate as our own." We need to assimilate Christ as the bread of life. while we call on
the Lord He gest into us and He touches a part of our natural being. but we resist. this is
indigestion. No way for the food to get into your inward parts. Lord, have the thoroughfare
within my being.

## IV.

The spirit and the word go together to give us something tangible. but we don't need the word
in a doctrinal way. we need the spirit to get the essence of the word.

Not just listen to the word. how much we need to digest and assimilate. When we see this in a
?? we need to deal with the word. We're used to being entertained. exercise to deal with the
lord. open the chambers of our heart.

amos 8:1 days are coming when I will send a hunger into the land for hearing the words of jehovah

don't assume the lord will speak to us. have we cooperated with what the lord spoke to us last time?
