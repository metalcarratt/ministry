# Message 6 - Christ as the Word of God

what is the bible? the autobiography and history of the journeying triune god as the word of God.

the bible is a divine romance. the bachelor God wants to become the married god.
the bachelor God became the creating god. the creating god became the incarnated god. next he became the redeeming god. then he entered into resurrection to become the compounded god as the life giving spirit. next is the intensified god. the indwelling god. finally the incorporated god.

## I. Christ is the word of god - the definition, explanation, and expression of God.

he is the I am. 

Micah 4:2 his goings forth are from the days of eternity. he was going forth in his incarnation, in his human living, in his crucifixion, in his resurrection, in his coming into our being. he is going forth into the parts of our soul.

### c. five events in john 1 - the creator (creation), the tabernacler (incarnation), the lamb (crucifixion), the anointing spirit (transformation), the ladder joining earth to heaven (building)

every time we come to the word "Lord I come to you in your holy Word." the logos must be converted to rhema, the instant, applied word, the word "with your name on it."

## ii. christ as the word of god speaks through creation

when god first talked to job he asked him about the animals. can you explain why the crocodile is afraid of the hippo? why the horse charges fearlessly into battle. after god spoke all these things job said I am nothing.

man is without excuse because creation proves their is god.

- the **abundance of light** in the universe shows that light is a divine characteristic
- the **greatness** of the universe manifests the greatness of god
- the **wonder** of the universe manifest how wonderful god is. this means he is incomprehensible
- the **beauty** of the universe manifest gods beauty
- gods arrangement and preparation for man and his every needs shows his lovinging kindness toward man.

the spirit, the word and light were the instruments god used to create light. the spirit of god was brooding. and god said, Let there be light. christ as the spirit, the reality of God. brooding over the waters of death to generate life. christ as the word is the speaking of god. christ as the light is the shining of god.

## iii. christ as the word of god speaks for god as the tabernacle of god

gods building is a godman. 

he made god contactable, touchable, receivable, experiencable, and enjoyable. Immanuel, god with us. acts 18:10, "I myself am with you." Joseph's secret was god was with him. 

## Iv. christ as the word of god speaks by becoming the lamb of god for redemption

## v. christ as the word of god speaks by becoming the anointing spirit to transform us into stones for gods building

### b. be watchful not to allow anything to replace christ as the anointing spirit in our spirit.

to live in the principle of the antichrist is to be anti the anointing. anti is not just against but in place of, instead of. don't allow culture, ethics, religion or natural concepts to replace the anointing. we should pray. "Lord, we want to live and walk in, with, through, and by the anointing--the moving, working, and saturating of the triune god within us."

## vi. christ as the word of god speaks through his becoming the ladder that joins heaven to earth for God's building

Jacob "and he dreamed". ladder. none other than the house of god, the gate of heaven. Gen 28. most crucial matter in the revelation of god. the house of god. bringing god to man and man to God. that's the church life. the principle of a dream is that something impossible happens. every spiritual vision is a dream. for us to get saved is a dream. to come in to the church life is a dream.
