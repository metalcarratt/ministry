# Message 12 - Taking the way of life in the Lord's recovery

The subject of message 12 is taking the way of life in the Lord's recovery. It may sound simple. In a way it is. But as we come to the burden, toward the end of the message, we will be blessed if we are poor in spirit, if we are pure in heart, that is, we are living under the reality of the kingdom. We are in the Lord's recovery. He brought us here. He has kept us here. He is shepherding us here. We wouldn't want to be anywhere else. In the church and in the universal fellowship in the Body. Receiving the benefit of the new covenant ministry.

**Life**. The way of life. Life is God. We are talking about the unique life, which is God Himself. The Father God is life. Christ the Son is life. The life-giving Spirit is life. The words spoken by the Lord are spirit and life. To take the way of life is to take the way of the Triune God being dispensed into us continually.

**Way**. What is my real understanding of the word 'way'? It has two basic meanings. The way denotes a direction, a path. If I ask how I can go to the beach, can you show me the way? That's the path, the direction. The way also means the method, the procedure. The way we do this. I don't know how to cook anything. The best I can do is heat water and put on certain kinds of breakfast food. So I need to know what is the way to do it. What is the means, the method. So the way is the path leading to the right direction, and the method. Christ Himself said, I am the way. The way of life is, intrinsically, Christ who is life being the way.

**Taking**. Two basic things. If we have you at our house for a meal, and we asked if you would like some ice cream, and then you say, I would like to take some of that. That means you want to reach out and possess it. You engage in some activity. Reaching out, grasping, possessing, something important to you. Also, take refers to action. When you take action. Do something.

This message is about our being in the Lord's recovery, and about taking the way of life in the Lord's recovery. This is something continually active. Whenever we are passive we are in death. Passivity equals death. Exercise our spirit, turn our heart to the Lord, call on Him, pray and read His Word. To take action. We have to be careful. Don't be confident in ourselves in any way at all. Saying, I'm in the Lord's recovery, I choose the life. Well then, what actions characterise your living? In what way are you reaching out to gain this, contact this, to be one with this?

To me, 'taking the way of life' is altogether new to me this morning. Any errors, mistakes, failures are usually because I'm not taking the way of life. Therefore I'm not proceeding in this direction.

Eight roman numerals. First four on the vision, the divine view. There are two particular burdens in the second half of the outline.

## I. The three books (J, J, R) present a picture of two aspects of God's move - economical and essential

We need the power from on high. We need the life that we inhale and drink and eat.

### A. Joshua, Judges on the move of God in power, illustrated by Samson, in the Spirit of power but not of life

Samson is not a type of Christ but Boaz is. But he is a type of the power of God's move.

### B. Ruth a book on life, using Naomi, Ruth and Boaz as examples

### C. We should not take the way of power but the way of life

This is true. I don't want to hear Him say, worker of lawlessness. I don't want to do some kind of outward work that seems to be great but to take the way of life. Otherwise so many things in our work will not pass the test of fire. On that day the fire will test everyone's work. What will pass the test of fire? The work carried out in the way of life. Then the power of the economical spirit is applied to do this intrinsic aspect of the work.

### D. Only life can bring forth Christ

What will bring Christ back? Just the outward world situation? A lot of increase? That's not sufficient. It is life. Life in that corporate person, the prepared Bride.

Just compare Samson with Boaz. Who's the pattern? Who's the pattern for you? Mighty man? Look what he did at the end, moving the pillars, destroying the building. Or just a simple person like Boaz, with the way he took to take Ruth as his spouse.



## II. What life is - God's life is the unique life

### A. Life is mysterious for life is God Himself.

1974 - Brother Lee began the lifestudy of Matthew and John. He prepared the recovery version of Romans. He was burdened to have the life-study of Romans. He had eye surgery and couldn't speak. Four brothers who were co-workers gave the training message on life. Sadly 3 of the 4 left the recovery. What those brothers did - they gave the messages. I'm not better, I'm not immune. Look, what a training, wonderful messages. Then four years later one leads a rebellion. Fourteen years later another causes division. So brother Lee came in in a wheelchair and a word he had recorded was played to us. His opening word was this: 'life is mysterious for life is God Himself.' 

Definitions of the way of life (A. 1-5). It's not just a term. "It's the life, life, life that makes us want to shout." But now we need to realise, we should have this in our being. We are talking about the Triune God being dispensed into us.

### B. God's purpose was for man to receive Him as life to become a man of life, a God-man



## III. Know the significance of the tree of knowledge of good and evil and turn to the tree of life

Doing what is right in our own eyes - whenever we do this we are living according to the tree of knowledge, right and wrong. We need to turn absolutely from this tree to the tree of life. I have a situation about which I have strong feelings. Where will I go? I need to turn strongly to the tree of life. 

### A. The tree of life signifies Christ as our food

### B. Christ is the fulfillment of the tree of life.

When we were regenerated, the tree of life came into our spirit.

### C. The tree of knowledge signifies Satan

The devil tempted the Lord quoting scripture. Using the words of the Bible to carry out his evil intention. So when we separate certain religious and spiritual things from the Triune God as life we are in danger, for the enemy in his subtlety will bring in death. Oh, to have to hear that word in that day, I did not recognise you.

### D. Four cases that illustrate the principle of life vs good and evil (John 4, 8, 9, 11)

Do not care for good and evil but life. What about this week. What did we care for. We are in a training. Lord, train us to care for life. The best way to discern a matter is to discern life and death. When I see texts and emails, immediately the first thing to discern is, is this life or death. If it's death, delete. It's not worthy to read. When other were causing rebellion and division I was considering, where is the life? All the things you're claiming, it's just death. Brother Lee has life. I choose life.



## IV. Christ is our life

We are children of God, member of life, we all have the same life.

### A. The life of Christ has become our life.

For Christ to be our life means He is subjective to us. To say Christ has become our life is to say Christ has become us.

### B. Christ is our life is an indication we are to take Him and live Him in our daily life

I'm still learning this. I need training, I need discipline. Throughout the day, in every aspect, this is a life long learning and training.

This gives us a broad picture of life. Who it is, how it functions. It should be our pathway. Life is the way. Life is the means. If anyone is appointed to be an elder, life is the way to be an elder. Life is the way to be the wife of an elder. This has to actually happen. If the bride is to make herself ready, the bridge has to be this kind of person, living this way.

Now we turn to certain aspects of the application of this and our experience.

## V. Two possible ways of our life and work - the way that leads to life and the way that leads to destruction

Matt 7:13-14

> Enter in through the narrow gate, for wide is the gate and broad is the way that leads to destruction and many are those who enter through it. Because narrow is the gate and constricted is the way that leads to life, and few are those who find it.

I wonder, who are the many? Does that many apply to us? Might it apply to us? Do you think it only applies to those "out there"? The Lord will examine, the Lord will determine. Or the few who have found the constricted way? My heart is concerned for the younger ones. Many are brought up and baptised. Then the broad way comes. This narrow, constricted way. I want to get out of here. They will be saved but it will cost them the kingdom. We can't force this on anyone. We have to teach, shepherd, minister, fight. That the 'few' would eventually include thousand and thousands of saints in the Lord's recovery.

### A. To take the way of life we need to enter the narrow gate and walk on the constricted way

It's one thing to say that at 17 or 24. But then as the decades go by and this or that is happening, then the test will come. Now, the way is much more constricted than in the beginning. I came into the recovery in 1966. I can say the way is much more constricted now than at any other stage in my life. And I am thankful for it. The narrow constricted way.

- deals with inward motive.
- the old man, self, flesh, human concept - all excluded
- only that which corresponds with God's will
- lifelong. no retirement, no vacations. life is 24/7.

The kingdom life is the constricting factor. We can't think that, do that, say that. It's the life within that's constricting us. There is no glory for you here. Nothing here for you except Christ and the church. How inspiring it is to hear and see brothers and sister taking the narrow way all the way to the end. The life in them is in us.

Like Moses. I'm not an Egyptian, I'm an Hebrew. Don't be afraid of turning 80. You might be entering into the best stage of your life.

### B. the broad way is according to the worldly system

- satisfying the natural taste
- to get the crowd
- to maintain a career
- to achieve man's enterprise

This word is just not in my vocabulary - career. You want to achieve something in the world, to be great. It's different from advancing in your profession. Like Daniel, who lived for God.

### C. The way of life that leads to a living reward in life - the way of the Lord's recovery

My greatest concern is the nature of the Lord's recovery might become corrupted. That the nature would not change. Not become part of the religious system in Christianity. I'm so thankful to be in the Lord's recovery. From the broad way. What a blessing, what a privilege, what an honour, to be with the saints together on the constricted way. We comfort one another, care for one another, cover one another.



## VI. Need to live by the sense of life - the feeling, the consciousness of the divine life within us

A basic truth. In your daily living, are you inwardly clear concerning the difference between the sense of life in your spirit and your feelings and your emotion? Are you clear? Is this becoming clear? It's easier to determine if the mind is set on the flesh or on the spirit. But the feelings, the emotions. We are human, we will have them. Some of us may be misled, oh whatever I feel, that must be from the Lord. Maybe it is, maybe it's not. Why do you have confidence in what you feel? Some will share something and then there's many different views, but the one that began says I have to go along with my feeling. At that point the Body knows, this is you. This is your natural life. It's not the sense of life. The Body knows. You're a member of the Body. You're going contrary to the Body. The Body isn't judging your, or giving up on you. But we're clear. We shouldn't be confident. I learned this 57 years ago. Maybe the teaching is elementary, the experience is not.

It's a serious matter to attribute to the Triune God something in us that is really from our self. And we say, the Lord showed me, the Lord told me. This kind of person you cannot help. There's no doubt about our self. We all have feelings. Don't you want to know the difference between the sense of the Spirit, the difference between that, and your feeling? We don't learn it by analysing. But the cross discern the Spirit. Open to the cross to touch the feeling, and what passes through the cross is of the Spirit.

Something within says no, stop, this is you, this is your reaction. Repent, apologise. Stop, turn to me. I understand what's going on. In any day of my human life there's this kind of thing taking place. I am a trainee. I am not a trainer here. The trainer is in the heavens on the throne. I'm still learning.



## VII. Be victorious over the attack of death on the church and build up the Body in resurrection

Have you ever been in a prayer meeting where death was attacking the church through the way certain ones were praying. I've been in such meetings. Because someone is praying out of themselves, our of their feelings. Or the practice of being late half the time. Being there in our natural life. We need to take the way of life in every gathering of the church. Anytime we're with any saints, to be victorious over the attack of death.

The attack of the church comes from the gate of Hades - death. Satan's greatest fear is the church's resistance to the power of death.

I'm full of hope when the sisters terrify the enemy because they're conquering death by the resurrection life. The army is going to be a woman, a wife. How marvelous!

What was the Lord saying when He said the gates of Hades not prevail against the church? How can the most powerful thing apart from God, death, how can we prevail over it? It's because we're in resurrection life. The way of life is the way to resurrection. I want my whole being to be in resurrection.



## VIII. "We know that we have passed out of death into life because we love the brothers"-1 John 3:14a

In the context of something wonderfully positive. But there's a 14b-15 and another verse

> We know that we have passed out of death into life because we love the brothers. He who does not love abides in death. Everyone who hates his brother is a murderer and you know that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him.

John wrote this to his spiritual children. When he spoke about sin, he realised he was trying to train them to not sin. He also ministers what to do when they have a failure. When he spoke about not loving the world, he realised we can love the world in a certain a way. Its shocking to realise, everyone who hates his brother is a murderer. 

2:9

> he who says he is in the light and yet hates his brother is in the darkness until now

And this is what is painful to say. I'm not aiming this at any person. In the last two years certain things came my way. Certain situations required my help along with others. I realised something. There are murderers in this spiritual sense. They are living in the principle of a murderer. They are not actually murderers. But some of the emails I received were indescribably wicked, full of hatred. When someone is full of hatred they would be happy if the one they hate is gone. These are some of the things I typed down from the lifestudy of John

> not loving the brothers is evidence of living in the essence and element of the satanic death and abiding sphere.

Here is brother A and brother A hates brother B. And brother B know this. You can sense it. We're not numb. He hates me. Sister C hates sister D. And sister D can discern this. I realised this kind of situation, this sister hates me. This is rare. But we dare not think this is impossible. I've witnessed this. I've seen the effects of it. I have no idea how to handle it apart from to pray. Not loving the brothers is evidence we are not in the realm of life, we are in the realm of darkness and death. Living according to the Satanic life and nature.

I'm not taking sides. But I've never witnessed such ongoing hatred. On the mainstream media, just hate, wishing he would be killed, assassinated. In NY city they have a plays on Caesar. The actor was dressed up to look like Donald Trump. what hatred has infiltrated the world in which we are living. We are a counter testimony. The kingdom teaching is love your enemies. we should not hate anyone.

> love is the nature of the divine life we have received. because the essence of God is love the life of God is the way of life.

If we have not passed out of death into life in this particular situation we are in death and in principle we are murderers.

> everyone who hates his brother is a murderer. In principle hatred equals murder. Not an actual murderer. in spiritual ethics, hatred equals murderer. one may not be an actually murderer, but he may be a murderer in principle.

When we are aware powerful negative feelings, we need to realise what they are we need to come to the Lord and cry out to Him. He knows, He is for us. We don't want to live this out.

> if we hate someone in principle we are behaving as a murderer. We should not hate anyone.

So John put these two verses side by side. I did not have the life and peace to ignore it. I want the Lord to search me now. I don't want to be shocked *then*. I want to clear up everything. Our Father is for us.

In our position we were transferred our of death into life. But John is talking about our actual present situation in relation to all the brothers and sister. As we are about to partake of the Lord's table there should be the inner witness, I am at peace with all the brothers and sisters so now I can partake of the bread and the cup.

The way of life is brand new to me. Taking the way of life. Lord, I choose to take the way of life. In every matter, in every situation. In my personal life, family life, church life, serving. But Lord, I need You to reproduce Yourself in Me. Thank You Lord, You are the faith by which we have believed. Lord, You are our love, and in this love we love all the brothers and sisters, and by this we know we have passed out of death into life.

Lord, we present every aspect of this message, every trainee, the speaking brothers to You. Lord, work out in our lives personally and in the churches corporately all You have released. We give ourselves to You afresh. We pray especially for all the dear young people. Preserve the nature of Your recovery. What else could we do other than cry out to You. We want to be able to say every day, I have passed our of death into life. I love all the saints. So Lord, make this so clear to all of us. We pray for every saint, every elder, every leading brother, every serving one, co-worker. Bring us on in the way of life. We can only say in Your name, we choose to take the way of life. We slam the door in the face of the enemy and say no to death. We say yes to life, which is You dear Lord. We love You and we love every member of Your Body.
