# The intrinsic significance of Gideon as God's valiant warrior

Gideon has the most verses of all the judges. 

We need to be those who join ourselves to God and reject Satan. If you do not, the result is chaos. This is what we see in Judges 9. There was total chaos in Gideon's family after he departed and then in society. There's a lesson for us to learn there.

There are two other thing repeated in Judges. 2:11, "The children of Israel did what was evil in the sight of Jehovah and served the Baals." This is repeated eight times in the book of Judges. It's very significant. Another thing. The last book of Judges says this, "In those days there was no king in Israel. Every man did what was right in his own eyes." These words were repeated four times in the book of Judges. It is a great wickedness and a great evil to reject God as our King, Lord, Head and Husband. Lord I take You as my King today. The first verse in the NT talks about Jesus being the son of David and the son of Abraham. David is first is because the major characteristic of Christ is that Christ is our king. 

Brother Lee uses the phrase "intrinsic significance" a lot. He means it has everything to do with God's eternal economy. If we have these glasses the whole Bible is open to us.

## I. Gideon raised us by God as His valiant warrior sent to save Israel from the Midianites. The intrinsic significance of Gideon's success.

If we look at Judges 6:12-14, we see the Angel of Jehovah appeared to Gideon and said, "Jehovah is with you." He was in an insignificant tribe. He might have considered himself an insignificant person. The Angel of Jehovah is Christ Himself as the One sent by God to save His people in suffering. When the Lord appeared to Moses in the thorn-bush. The first mention of 'who' was in that thorn-bush was the Angel of Jehovah. Later you find out the Angel of Jehovah is actually God Himself, and also the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.  Gideon was very sincere with the Lord. Build up a habit of conversing with the Lord. In one message brother Lee said one of the best ways to enjoy the divine dispensing is just to talk to the Lord. Hymn 255, I am breathing out my sorrow, breathing our my sin. Why? So I can breath all His fullness in. Teach me how to breath into Your bosom all my life of self and sin. Gideon said, "Please my Lord, if God is with us why have all these things happened to us?" Jehovah turned to him and said, "Gideon, go in this strength of yours and save Israel from the hand of Mideon. Indeed I have sent you." Jesus said, "He who sent Me is with Me. He has not left Me alone because I always do the things that are pleasing to Him." This person is inside of us. When we exercise our spirit we're identified with Him. We are one with Him. Lord, since You sent Me, I want You to be with Me. The Lord will answer this prayer. I remember specific instance when Benson asked me to go somewhere and I went and cried out to the Lord and the Lord gave me this verse.

Four characteristics (A - D)

### A. Gideon listened carefully to the Word of God

Make me a person who listens carefully to Your Word. Not just the logos. I want to come to You as the rhema. This was rare among the children of Israel at this time. It reminded me of Samuel, in 1 Samuel. He was just a little boy. Hannah was praying in her heart. Eli could see her lips moving but no sound. He thought she was drunk. She said she was just pouring out her soul before the Lord. Eli said may the Lord grant your request. In her request she told the Lord if you give me a son I will give him back to you. When he was very small, 3-5 years old, she and her husband brought him to the temple, and left him with Eli. Eli, he is under your supervision now. I still remember the first day I went to kindergarten. I saw my mum and she was crying. But Hannah did this. I don't think Hannah was in tears. She was full of joy because the Lord answered her prayers. Samuel actually slept by the ark of Jehovah. That's the best place to sleep. That's where he was sleeping. 1 Sam. 3:1, "The Word of Jehovah was rare in those days." God's speaking was almost lost. It was rare in those days. At the time of Gideon it was something that was rare. The Lord found someone called Gideon who would listen to His Word. With Samuel, the Lord called three times. The first few times Samuel went to Eli. Brother Lee said Samuel learned positive things from Eli but also observed negative things from Eli which became a warning that preserved him for his whole life. Here's what Eli said, "When you hear that voice say, speak O Jehovah for your servant is listening." This should be our attitude. Samuel grew and Jehovah was with him and let none of his words fall to the ground. Because Samuel's words were the Lord's words. It was established by Jehovah and everyone in Israel knew that this young person was a prophet of Jehovah. Jehovah continued to appear in Shiloh to Samuel by the Word of Jehovah. He reveals Himself by His Word.

Another example was Mary. When Gabriel visited Mary. Mary says, "How can this happen to me?" v 37, Gabriel says, "No word will be impossible with God." Don't you love this word? Mary said, "Behold the slave of the Lord, may it happen to me according to Your Word."

This was the first characteristic Gideon had.

Rev.1:10-12, John was in spirit on the Lord's day and heard behind me. I turned to see the voice that spoke with me. I turned seven golden lampstands and one in the midst like the Son of Man.

Isa. 50:4-5, The Lord's human living.  He awakens me morning by morning. Even before your alarm. Before I go to bed tonight I want to ask the Lord to wake me up tomorrow morning. For what reason. He awakens my ear. He opens my ear. To hear as an instructed one. We're the Lord's disciples. The Lord Jehovah has given me the tongue of the instructed that I should know how to sustain the weary with a word. We've all been shepherded through different brothers and sisters. 

Exo. 21:6, the Lord as the slave saviour. I love my master, I love my wife, my children. I will not go our free. When need to be one with the Lord to say the same thing to Him. 

Br. Lee said this a lot, pray short prayers. Lord, give me an opened ear. Give me a circumcised ear. I want my hearing to be cleansed in the precious blood.

Rev. 2:7, he who has an ear, let him ear. We want to hear what the spirit says. To me it's a tragedy if we don't hear what the spirit says.

We have ears for one reason. To listen to God. One time br Lee was in an environment and another brother said, sorry and br Lee said, it's alright I exercise not to listen to that. We need to exercise our spirit to listen to the Word of God. What we hear governs what we do and how we walk. 

### B. Gideon obeyed God's Word and **acted** on it.

Faith the substantiation of things hoped for. It goes through verse by verse how they did everything by faith. Gideon was mentioned. Gideon was a person who did things by faith. He heard God's word and faith comes by hearing and hearing by the Word of Christ.

We have Christ's life of obedience and submission. What good news is that! I'm so happy that I can preach the gospel today. Paul said, I'm ready to preach the gospel to you in Rome. They were already believers. The gospel is the whole book of Romans. The gospel of God includes everything of the economy of God.

Phil. 2:5, Let this mind be in you. That's God's dispensing Christ's mind into your mind. Let this thinking be in you. I want Christ's thinking to be your thinking. This mind which was also in Christ Jesus. The very same mind. Isn't that a wonder? Our mind was created to contain the thoughts of Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God. The mind of a slave. We're hear to serve the saints. 

The people who know their God will show strength and take action. The Lord told me after I had been enjoying Him, you need to preach the gospel. I told one of my colleagues, I met Jesus. When you enjoy the Lord people don't have to tell you to preach the gospel. When we love the Lord we just want to serve.

Be filled inwardly and outwardly. I want you to remain in Galilee until you are clothed with power from on high.

### C. Gideon tore down the altar of Baal

The children of Israel took the chief male god of the Canaanites as their god, and the chief female god of the Canaanites (Asherah). God considered these idols as men with whom his wife had committed harlotry. An idol is anything that we love more than the Lord and replaced the Lord in our life. Son of Man, these people have set up idols in their heart.

The word Baal means master or possessor. When the Canaanites worshipped Baal they presented incense and offering to him. They even sacrificed children to him. The worship of Baal often involved immoral acts by his worshippers.

Gideon tore down this altar. It was his dad's altar and his dad's Asherah. That was a big thing to do that. He built an altar to Jehovah and offered a burnt offering with the wood of the Asherah. Gideon did it at night because he was too afraid. When the men rose and saw it, they were very upset.

### D. Gideon sacrificed his relationship with his father and his enjoyment of society to follow Jehovah

Because the whole Israelite society was following Baal. He had to sacrifice. His sacrifice was a strong factor of his success. If we could go around and hear the testimony of saint by saint you can hear the stories of sacrifice. Certain brothers sacrificed so much to come the way of the Lord's recovery.

The men rose up early in the morning, they said to one another, who has done this thing, they found out Gideon had done it, so they went to his father. They said, bring out your son that he may die. I like Joash at this point. "Will you contend for Baal or will you save him? Whoever contends for him will be put to death while it is still morning. if he is a god let him contend for himself." I'm so happy that Joash stood with his son. I almost feel like Joash was thinking, thank the Lord Gideon did this.

### E. Gideon received a reward - the economical spirit came upon him and he became powerful and with only 300 people he defeated kings who had people like a locust swarm in number

Judges 8:10, After the whole battle, there were 1500  survivors. 135,000 soldiers, vs 300. That is a ratio of 450:1. This conclusively proves that Gideon is not the hero, God is the hero.



## II. The selection of the overcomers is seen with the selection of the three hundred men.

The Lord appeared to Gibeon, "You will strike the Mideonites as one man" Those 302 men (+Gideon +God). 

God told Gideon, the people with you are too many. If I give you too many people Israel may say my own has saved me. I want you to say, whoever is afraid and trembling should depart. 22,000 returned and 10,000 remained.  It was still too many. Everyone who laps as a dog, set them apart. They were looking up while they were drinking to see if the enemy is coming. They were on guard. They were 300 men. The rest bowed down on their knees to drink water.

### A. The account of Gideon shows us how to be an overcomer

**We must know the self**. Gideon said, by what way can I save Israel? That's the way Paul was. Less than the least. If anyone thinks he is something when he is nothing, he deceives himself. Lord rescue me from my ambition to be somebody in your recovery. You need to realise that you are zero and He is everything.

**We must see the heavenly vision**

**We must offer up ourselves by hearing and answering the Lord's call.**

**We must tear down the idols in our heart**. 

### B. God was indicated that He would fight for Gideon. The first selection

How can you believe when you receive glory from one another and you do not received the glory from the only God.

Do not be afraid. We should be positive and aggressive to invest our talent in the Body or by preaching the gospel.

Properly aggressive. 

### C. The second selection. Self-denying persons

The Spirit in our spirit is the self-denying Spirit. The Lord was perfect in His humanity, but He rejected Himself and lived by the Father's life.

### D. God made the 300 men one body, signified by a load of barley bread tumbling through the camp of the Midianites for their defeat and God's victory.

Gideon snuck down to the camp with one of his young men. God gave his enemy a dream to tell them what was going to happen to them. A round loaf of barley bread came and crushed the tent.

What is that round loaf of barley bread. Judges 6:16, surely I will be with you and you will strike the Midianites as one man. 301 men in one accord with no opinion at all. Barely signifies resurrection. Bread signifies the church. One interpretation - a blended group of co-workers in one accord in resurrection. Our vital group, the elders, etc. Blended into one. Not a square loaf, a round loaf. Like the wheel for the moving of God's economy. It tumbles through the camp of God's enemy, turning the camp upside down.

God has blended the Body together. That there might be no division in the Body.

### F. weary yet pursuing
