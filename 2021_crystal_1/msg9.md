# Message 9 - The children of Israel not having a king and everyone doing what was right in his own eyes

When those who fought for the land passed away the cycle started - of turning away from God, worshipping idols, doing what was right in their own eyes, God coming into judge, they crying out to Him, He sending them a judge, and after that judge passed away the cycle would repeat again.

 Jud. 2.

> All that generation were gathered to their fathers. Another generation that did not know Jehovah rose up after them. Did what was evil and served the Baals. Forsook Jehovah the God of their fathers and followed gods from the peoples that surrounded them. They forsook Jehovah and served Baal and Asheroth. The anger of Jehovah burned and delivered them into the hand of plunderers. They were no longer able to stand against their enemies.
>
> And Jehovah raised up judges. Yet they did not listen to their judges either. But they went about as harlots after other gods and worshipped them. When Jehovah raised up judges for them He saved them throughout all the days of the judge. But when the judge died they turned and acted more corruptly than their fathers by following after other gods in order to serve them.

This is part of the picture not only of Israel but of degraded Christianity, and to an extent degradation that may creep into the recovery. We are not immune. The subject is Israel not having a king and everyone doing what was right in their own eyes. Four times the writer of Judges says there was no king in Israel. Twice the writer says everyone did what was right in his own eyes.

In Samuel the people cried out for a king. But they wanted a king like all the other nations. They were not placing themselves after God's authority, they were rebelling. But having no king, and doing what is right in your own eyes, is the situation on the earth, in Christianity. Even among us, or the potential among us. This is not a history lesson on what happened thousands of years ago. The emphasis will be how God in His economy counteracts every negative thing portrayed in Judges and raises up the overcomers to bring in His kingdom.

## I. Israel became chaotic in government, worship and morality

- Did not drive out and destroy the seven tribes. Not absolute
- Followed the gods of the people around them. The gods of the people signify the Satanic powers surrounding every one of us. Spending so much time on the internet. We may not realise what the effect is, immediately and long term.
- God's hand was against them "for evil"
- Darkest period of the history of Israel. Also a period of tragedy. Rebellions against God, idolatry, in-fighting, hostility, fornication, filthiness, brutal killings.

## II. No king; everyone did what was right in his own eyes

- No king means Israel had annulled God and His status. Did not recognise God's kingship. Not doctrinally, in their being. Denying his authority, kingship.
- there was the tabernacle, high priest, Urim and Thummim, but no government, no administration.
- Moses charged them not to do what was right in their own eyes but not in the eyes of God.
- The people were not just corrupt; the enemy was behind the whole scene, and he was using the people for his own evil intention; to be lawless and godless; to cast off restraint.
- Doing "what is right" - many damaging things have happened because people felt they were doing "what is right" - this gives the self so much boldness to be audacious. Yes, you are living according to the tree of knowledge of good and evil. Rather than bringing matters to the Lord. There's no neutrality between the two trees. It's either doing what's right in our eyes, or living according to God, His will, what is right in His eyes, His life and nature. There's no neutrality.
- No king means no authority. The people did what they pleased. Both in the world and in Christianity it is like this. No God. Everything according to their own ways. Even in Christianity as a system. All the seminaries, governed by this, by what is right, what is good.
- In the Lord's recovery - we need to be and can be delivered.



## III. God is the king of the ages - with absolute authority - for eternity - who never changes.

### A. The God we believe in is dispensing Himself into us

God's kingdom on earth today is God's sovereign rule within.

### B. Christ born to be the King

He's the king who shepherd's God's people. We do not believe simply what we see. The King of kinds and Lord of lords.

As a King He comes as a God-man.

He is our King, reigning in our hearts. The kingdom of Christ in the local churches is reigning in our hearts. This saves us from doing what is right in our own eyes. That would be the self reigning, the kingdom of the self. But when we realise that Christ our King is reigning in our hearts and recognise the kingship in the local churches. Then we live under this kingship. This is something we all need to learn. We all hope to be overcomers, co-kings. But hope will not accomplish anything by itself. We need to learn what it means to live under His kingship. Out mind, our thoughts, our feelings.

He's not in us as a dictator, a tyrant, He's in us as the King of glory. He's in us patiently developing us, training us, in a very exact and detailed way. By the time we end our journey there will be the inner witness that we have learned everything we need to learn.

Eph. 3, making His home in our hearts. He's not invading or attacking, but is determined to subdue and train us. The more we know our eternal king. I may not know why something is happening in me, but you are My God.

**Lovingkindness**-this  is how He rules. Not with a rod of iron, but with a tender shepherding heart. 

**Encouragement**. **Restoration**. Our Christian life is not that simple. There are cycles. Sometimes we go forward and sometimes we go backwards a little. "Do not boast against me, O my enemy, for when I fall I will rise again." My king, He comforts me, encourages me, restores me.

If we allow Christ to reign - an active function of our will - this will bring in the kingdom - lovingkindness, truthfulness, faithfulness, justice, righteousness. He will make you the same as He is in all these virtues. Sounds like high-peak.



## IV. rescued from lawlessness

Only God knows who on the earth really cares the perfect ordained will of God, concerning Christ and the Church and concerning them.

Walking according to self will and rebelling against God's authority is sin. In 1 Corinthians, Paul mentions a discord between two brothers. One of them, instead of bringing the matter into fellowship, sued the other, his brother. Paul spoke directly; why would you do that? Go to the people in the world? It's better to suffer lose. But a number of times brothers or sisters have taken such action because it is "right" in their own eyes. They might be "right with themselves" but not with God. What would happen in the next six months if thousands of saints would all open to the Lord and say, Lord, enlighten me concerning self will. Lord don't let me live another day in the darkness of self will. The self will is strong. When you're convinced, I am right. I am right. I don't need to pray. I know. I come to the Lord's table, why would you say I'm rebellious. 

Those that are teaching little children, we don't say boys and girls, he and she, you can be whatever you want. God made male and female. To deny that is to deny God. The Lord must have a counter testimony among those who submit to God's authority.

On the news one man attacked a middle aged Chinese woman. He had been arrested 17 times. Released again and again. This is the age in which we are living in. It will increase until the man of lawlessness is revealed. We must live against this. We are the kingdom people.

I'm not different from any other person. But you died for me to redeem me from lawlessness.

> not everyone who says to me Lord, lord, will enter into the kingdom of the heavens, but he who does the will of my father who is in the heavens. many will say was it not in your name we prophesied and cast out demons and did many works of power. I will declare to them, I never knew you. Depart from me, you workers of lawlessness

This word is spoken to believers, not unbelievers. Actually written by Matthew to the kingdom people, this is addressed to us. A testimony. In 1955 when I was 16, the Lord continually called me and said I want you to be a minister. For 9 years I went from one stage of my education to another. Finished theological training in 1964. For some reason (someone must have prayed) in my being was this desire - I want to do the perfect will of God. I will not settle for the permissive will. I didn't know what the perfect will of God was. The Lord honoured that prayer and separated me from so many things until I made a decision to leave the entire system of Christianity. The Lord is leaving me to go out to California and when I get there I will find what His will is. I met the Lord's recovery, learned about local churches. Completed my study of the normal Christian church life. realised this is home. Then my wife and I moved to Los Angeles and I had some time before I started my teaching job the year before. I was desperate concerning these verses in Matthew. I want to do the will of the father. I don't want to hear you say, worker of lawlessness. I don't care what you did, you didn't do my father's will. The Lord showed me, this is not salvation here. This is the coming kingdom. If you want to be here, you must do the will of my father. only the lord knows to what extent I've been faithful to that. But I believe he will witness on my behalf. I live for this. whatever the will of God is, I choose that. All kinds of things happened, but the deep comfort is, this is the will of God.

In order to be saved and enter the kingdom we simply need to call on the Lord, believe in our heart God has raised Him from the dead. So simple. But it's not enough to enter the coming kingdom. He made it clear to us. Yes, you should keep calling, to drink Me, to breath Me, but you must do the will of My Father. I began to see, how can I do what I don't know. The Lord taught me through messages from a man from China. Through him I learned what no theologian or professor could ever teach me. The Lord knows, on that day, I don't want to say to Him, look what I did, look how hard I worked, I did this and travelled there. I don't want to if it's not God's will. He allows me to do it and in a certain way blesses it. Now there's another standard. You did all this in my name, but I don't recognise you. I don't acknowledge anything you did. the criterion is, my father's will. At 33 1/2 the Lord said, not my will but yours be done. May the Lord raise up another generation of brothers and sisters and gain ground in saints of all ages, that there would be no compromise, no more permissive will. The father's will, to do it, whatever it is.

God's kingdom is the unique realm or kingdom where God's will can be done. If we are truly becoming the reproduction of Christ we will be will-of-God people. We will learn the difference between prayers that have the terminology but did not issue from God.

We shouldn't think because we are in the Lord's recovery that everything's fine. I don't want to find out the Lord let us have this event and do this and that, but He tells us that was not what was on My heart. That was what you felt to do. I have to be faithful to you. We should not be self-confident in any way concerning the work we are doing. There is one standard, the will of our father who is in the heavens. Even the composition of this outline, I can testify, this came from the father's inward being. It's not only the Lord Jesus speaking, it's God our Father making known His will.

## V. Chaos - and it's conquest

We are surrounded by chaos. The Lord will not pluck us out of it yet. We need to learn how to conquer it, personally and corporately.

We pray that the Lord would take us out of certain "chaos", but the Lord may leave us there to say, no I want to train you to overcome it.

The divine economy is a person, not a thing. He has come into us to put everything into order.

The unshakeable God is becoming the constituent of our inner being, and I am being built up with others. In the midst of the chaos there is the reality of the kingdom.

*The overcomers conquer the satanic chaos and carry out the divine economy.*

We want to hear Him say, "Well done, good and faithful slave. You did the Father's will. Come into My wedding feast."

There is no easy answer to the outward chaos. But we're not going to focus on the chaos. We're going to focus on our Christ who conquered chaos. He is training us to be His overcomers and making us the same as He is.
