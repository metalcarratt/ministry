Crystallization-Study of Joshua, Judges and Ruth - Message Four

# The need for God's people to seek the Lord's direction and have the Lord's presence to display His victory for the building up of His Body and the spreading of His kingdom

Two things - building up and spreading.

Key Statement #2 - In order for us to fully gain and possess Christ as the all-inclusive land for God's building, we must learn to be kept, to be ruled, to be governed and to be guided by the direct first-hand presence of the Lord; if we have the Lord's presence, we have wisdom, insight, foresight, and inner knowledge concerning things; the Lord's presence is everything to us.

This matter of the Lord's presence is indeed the greatest thing. As we are entering into the God-given land to gain this all-inclusive One, to possess Him and also to be possessed by Him, so that God may have a building in that land for a testimony. By doing so there would be a way for God to be incarnated in Christ one day, that is to bring forth Christ. All of this is related to God's eternal economy.

The hidden, intrinsic significance of Joshua, Judges and Ruth - commanding, full, proper view. The intrinsic significance of these three books. We are not here just to talk about history. We know these stories. Jericho, Ai, the Gibeonites. All of these are interesting and wonderful stories. But my burden is to know the intrinsic significance of these histories. I want to read a little bit from the lifestudy of Joshua.



"The Bible begins with God's creation. God's eternal economy consists of two things, Christ and His counterpart. This counterpart will consummate in the New Jerusalem as the full expression of the Triune God for eternity. The intrinsic significance of the book of Joshua is the taking of the land which signifies gaining Christ, plus the gaining of the proper persons that Christ might spread and increase. Chapter 1 is concerned with the gaining of Christ and chapter 2 the spreading of Christ, with the bringing forth of Christ to others. Eventually Jesus will be born as God incarnate in this land. The spreading of Christ is for the bringing forth of this Christ to others. For the gaining of Christ we need to be today's Joshua. For the spreading we need to be today's Rahab. Thus we need to be both a Joshua and Rahab."

Rom I - Joshua and Rahab; Rom II - defeat at Ai; Rom III - Gibeonites.

## I. When two spies came to Jericho, Rahab contacted them, hided them that acts that issues out of faith. She believed in the God of Israel and declared, "Jehovah your God is God above and on earth beneath."

Her faith. The acts that issue out of her faith. This woman possessed not just a passive faith. No, she had an active faith. A faith confirmed and strengthened by her acts.

A - Jehovah provided Rahab to Joshua. Jehovah did not use a lot of things but this one woman called Rahab the harlot. Isn't this something? God's way is higher than our ways. God's thoughts, God's way, is higher than ours. She turned to Israel and their God. For this Gentile Caananite. She just turned, among so many who did not. She turned to Israel and to the God of Israel. She trusted in this God of Israel and His people. She heard the report like all the other people in Jericho. How God delivered them from Egypt and how He defeated some of these tribes. She heard these stories and by hearing these things, like much we heard the gospel, she had the hearing of faith. The way we believe is still by hearing. Hearing the good news. Hearing the gospel of Christ. By hearing faith rising up within us. Faith is generated within us to believe what we have heard. In this case she believed in the God of Israel, and not only in Him but in God's people.

B- Rahab and her house were saved. A great example of household salvation. The scarlet thread signifies an open, public confession. She hid those spies but used that scarlet thread to openly confess her faith. That scarlet thread signifies the redeeming blood of Christ, the blood of the Lamb. She believed that by this sign she and her household would be delivered. This is a sign pointing right to Christ and the blood He shed for our redemption.

C- Rahab was a prostitute in a place cursed by God for eternity. Rahab was one of those people. But after turning to God and His people, she married Salmon. Salmon was the son of a leader of Judah. Probably one of the two spies. Who we are joined to among God's people is incredibly important. Who we associate with. The right person of the right tribe. By that marriage she brought forth someone named Boaz who eventually married Ruth out of whom Christ came. She became associated with Christ for the fulfilment of God's eternal economy. Rahab is one of the grandmothers of Christ. Isn't this something? Isn't this marvellous? What a picture. We all should be Rahab today.

D- This shows, regardless of our background, if we turn to God and His people and are joined to His people we will bring forth proper fruit and participate in the enjoyment of the birthright of Christ.

Two words of takeaway - faith, association

**Faith**. To believe in God by faith. Not just a passive faith. In these days let us have the active, working faith. The faith that brings about some good issue and result.

**Association**. Whom we associate with among the people of God is very important. Even for us in the church life. We must associate with the proper ones and the right ones and be joined to them so we can bring forth the proper fruit.



## II. At Ai Israel lost the presence of the Lord he sent the spies not for gaining the land but for fighting.

It is a serious serious matter to loose the presence of God. To not have the presence of God. We all know in Exodus, Moses was a companion of God in the mountains. He was face to face with God, bargaining with God, for His presence to go with Him. "Now therefore if I have found favour in Your sight, consider this nation Your people." "My presence will go with you and I will give you rest." No greater promise. You don't need anything else, anyone else. You don't need to trust in any other. My presence is all you need. My presence will go with you. Not just I will go with you, my *presence* will go with you.

Br Lee has a story of some brothers travelling together on a train, but one brother sat in a different carriage, he wouldn't sit with them. He was with them, but his presence wasn't with them. This is a clear illustration. It's one thing to have the Lord, have His help, His direction. We can have those things but not have His presence. This is very very important. You can have the Lord's helping, the Lord's blessing, but really, deep down don't have the Lord's presence. Let us treasure the Lord's presence above all else. Lord, thank You for Your help, but above all I need Your presence. Your presence is for my entire being. Moses said, "If Your presence does not go with us do not bring us up from here." Even if it is a good, needful thing. Lord, if you're not with me, Lord don't bring me there, I will not go. We need to learn this. Thank Him that we can have His presence.

### A - The report about Ai indicated they had left God aside. They were not one with God and acted on their own. They acted independently. They did not have the Lord's presence and were separated from God because of their sin. After this defeat Joshua learned the lesson of staying before God's presence at the Ark.  

1. they sinned
2. they lost God's presence
3. they trusted in themselves
4. they lost their oneness with God

We should always be one with our God. The Lord is not only with us (next to us), the Lord is in us, and we are in Him. To be one spirit with the Lord is what we need to practice. Moment by moment, minute by minute. We have to learn to be one spirit with the Lord. 

When we set our mind on the Lord, we have the Lord's presence. When we have the Lord's presence, we will have another kind of wisdom. The heavenly wisdom. Spiritual insight. We will have a kind of foresight, a view into the future. When we have the Lord's presence. We will have the inner knowledge concerning things. Without this we make decisions based on some outer knowledge, the environment, an external understanding and analysis, but lacking something inward that comes from the presence of the Lord. Pray this. "Grant us Your presence Lord."

### B - God did not give Moses a map, directions of GPS. God gave Moses, His people, Himself, His presence, as the real roadmap

So many times I don't know which way to turn, what to say, where to turn next. There's just no way. But praise the Lord. When there is the presence of Him there is that instant roadmap before me, step by step. Actually the Lord leads us exactly this way. Once we know what to do we will often just neglect His presence. Many times God will not tell us what's next. It forces us to follow His presence.

God's presence is the criteria for every matter. Big, small - do you have the Lord's presence? Don't ask is this right or wrong. Outwardly all the boxes may check but inwardly you're missing the Lord's presence. Guided not by His second hand presence. No-one can have the Lord's presence for you. We can be too quick to seek our fellowship. We *need* fellowship, but we first need to learn to have the Lord's presence. Is the Lord smiling in you or frowning? Is it just something of the Lord's permissive will? His presence is the power to possess the all-inclusive Christ as the reality of the good land. We need the power to conquer the powers of darkness in the heavenlies so we can lay hold of this Christ. What is this power? God said, My presence will go with you and give you rest. Not only is He our way, He is our power to fight and possess this God land.

Nothing works but the Lord's presence. His being with us means everything. Nothing works. You may be smart. You may be able. Eventually nothing works. You may be taught certain spiritual matters, ways. Even those ways don't work so well. But the Lord's presence. As long as the Lord is with us, we have everything that we need.

### C - The first person to commit sin was Achan. Coveting a Babylonian garment, seeking to improve himself to make himself look better for appearance

Although this sin was committed by an individual, it affected the entire body of God's people. The garment was beautiful. Anything Babylonian is to make oneself look better for appearance. Apposed to something truthful, real within. Babylon is the principle of hypocrisy, falsehood. Looks one way on the outside and different on the inside. Remember that woman on the beast. A golden cup. Inward was abominations of fornication.

Ananias and Saphira wanted to be looked upon as someone who loved the Lord but kept some for themselves. They wanted to look good. They wanted man's praise. They were pretending. God's children need to be delivered from pretending before man. That's Babylonian. Whenever we put on a garment that does not match our actual condition we are in the principle of Babylon.

Everything done in falsehood in order to received glory from men is done in the principle of the harlot, not in the principle of the Bride.  May we be delivered from these sins of falsehood and deceit. Be in sincerity. Nothing false. What is on the outside is what is on the inside.

It is not how man sees that matters but Jehovah looks on the heart.

Two words of takeaway - presence, truthfulness.

## III. Deceived by the Gibeonites

The Gibeonites were devilish and mingled with demons. God wanted to wipe them out. The inhabitants of Gibeon deceived Israel with their craftiness. Israel was deluded, deceived.

Why the children of Israel were deceived - **they did not ask for the counsel of Jehovah**. 

The children of Israel were like a wife who forgot her husband. The whole Bible is a divine romance and record of how God courts His chosen people and marries them. We have to remember this relationship. When we think about our counsel which we seek from God we have to remember our status - that as a wife to God as the husband.

A wife should never leave her husband. We should never leave our husband Christ. Israel, even momentarily left the husband. Rather than checked with their husband they become an uncovered female. Even entered into a covenant without her husband. Satan went to Eve. If Eve has said stop it right there, I need to check with Adam instead. She just said good. She engaged Satan without her husband. She forgot her husband. She totally exposed herself to the enemy. This is what happened here.

It sounds simple, basic. In a way it is. But in our experience it is almost the first thing out the window. We just react, respond to something. Forgetting to pray. Let's do this. Forget to wait on Him. In our presumptuousness. Many times good intention. Trusting things we have learned in the past. Make a call. How often do we do this? Forgot that we are married. We are a wife. We have a head we should look to, check with, fellowship with. Every believer should we weak to the extend he does not have his own ideas, make his own decisions, take any action without consulting the Lord and allowing Him to make the decisions. We need to learn to be the weaker vessel. To have our head covered. Husband, how do you feel? Lord Jesus, what are you doing here? We need to fellowship with the Lord in all things. The more you go on, the more you realise, especially in the small things, we need the Lord's counsel, word, guidance. This is really a sweet living. In everything you let Him make the decisions.

If God leads you to take away that you do not know, "this forces you to have hundreds and thousands of conversations with Him, resulting in a journey that is an everlasting memorial between you and Him."

Two take way words - dependence, counsel

As a wife would depend on her husband we need to wholly depend on Him.

See our husband's counsel, our husband's word in everything.
