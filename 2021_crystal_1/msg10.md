# Message 10 - Ruth's choosing for her goal, exercising her right, seeking for her rest, and receiving a reward for God's economy

A point for each chapter. Choosing her goal is chapter 1, exercising her right is chapter 2, seeking her rest is chapter 3, receiving a reward is chapter 4.

It's not a small thing to pray, Lord I take You as my Head today, my Lord, King and Husband. The only way to take Christ as our blessing (Abraham) is to take Him as our King (David) first. Romans LS message 1 - the whole Bible is a romance of a universal couple.

Fourth banner - to be a normal Christian, to be one of today's overcomer - to be a normal Christian *is* to be an overcomer; Watchman Nee had books, *The Normal Christian Faith*, *The Normal Christian Church Life*, it's normal to be like this; it's normal to say, Lord Jesus I love You - to answer the Lord's present calling and to meet His present need in HIs recovery, we need to be today's Ruths, to enter into the land of Immanuel and to marry ourselves to Christ that we may bring forth Christ to meet today's need of both God and man. This should be the intrinsic significance of these three books. The issue of this training should be the gaining of the God-promised land for the bringing forth of Christ. 

Msg 6 of LS of Joshua. When we gain Christ He becomes our experience and enjoyment. Then He becomes in us what He should be. Experiencing and enjoyment will make Him real to us. This is not only for our enjoyment but for Him to become in us what He should be and what He desires to be. This is to gain Christ for Christ.

## I. Judges is a book of Israel's miserable history, dark and foul; Ruth, as an appendix to the book of Judges, is a record of a couple's excellent story, bright and aromatic; the main character in this story, Ruth, is like a lily growing out of brambles and a bright start in the dark night

I was watching a webcast on Ruth and I was asked to stand up and read some verses. So I stood up. While I was reading he would stop me. He would share what I read in his own way. But as he was doing that, he was so thrilled about what he was speaking, you could tell, this was a person who loved the Bible to the uttermost. Every word that came out of his mouth was life-giving. It was very enjoyable to me.

Bright and aromatic - our relationship with the Lord should be like that. Full of light, bright, aromatic. Paul said, we are a fragrance of Christ to God. Around Paul and his coworkers was something intangible. They gave off a fragrance of Christ. We want to be those so permeated with Christ we become a fragrance of Christ.

## II. Chapter 1 of the book of Ruth speaks of Elimelech's swerving from the rest in God's economy, Naomi's returning to the rest in God's economy, and Ruth's choosing for her goal.

Swerving, returning and choosing. Elimelech was Naomi's husband. Naomi had two sons. Her sons married two women of Moab. Because of their idolatry and opposition to Israel, God spoke severely about the Moabites. She has a husband and two sons. Her husband swerved because there was a famine in the land. Don't swerve. Elimelech passed away, and then his two sons died also. So Naomi was left there as a widow with two daughters in law. Naomi's daughters in law really loved her. Isn't that wonderful. Sometimes the in laws can have problems, but it wasn't the case here. When her husband and sons died, she made a decision to return to the good land. She mad a strong decision. I am going to return to the good land. I'm going to return to Bethlehem, the very place that Christ was born.

Ruth 1

> Naomi said to her two daughters in law, go and return to your mothers house. May Jehovah deal kindly with you. They lifted up their voice and wept, and said no, we will return with you to your people. Naomi said, return, why should you go with me? Even if I had a husband tonight and bore sons would you wait until they were grown. It has been far more bitter for me than it should be for you. They lifted up their voice and wept again. Ruth clung to her. Naomi said to Ruth, your sister in law has now returned to her people and her gods. 

Baal was the male god of the Caananites and ashteroth was the female god. the worship of Baal included the sacrifice of children and immorality was practiced. 

> Ruth said, do not entreat me to leave you; for wherever you go I will go, and wherever you dwell I will dwell, and your people will be my people, and your God will be my God. Where you die I will die and there will I be buried. Jehovah to so to me and more as well if anything but death keeps me from you.

The two of them were traveling and when they got to the city of Bethlehem the whole city was stirred up. She said call me Marrah - bitterness. 

They came at the right time, at the beginning of the barley harvest. Naomi said, I've come out full and come back empty. But by the end of the book of Ruth, Naomi is filled to overflowing. 

### A. Ruth is a book of rest

The Sabbath rest is Christ as our rest. You have not yet come to the Rest. The rest was the good land.

**Dominion**

God rested on the seventh day because he had attained what He had desired - man on earth expressing Him and representing Him with His dominion.

The reality of this is in the NT. Paul says, All things work together for good. What is the good here? That we would be conformed the image of the firstborn son of God. All things are working together for our good. All these circumstances are part of the oven we are living in outwardly. That works together so that we can be conformed to the very image of the firstborn Son of God. We should have an unveiled face every day, and whenever the heart turns to the Lord the veil shall be taken away. It's the gear that makes the whole machinery of God's eternal economy effective. Beholding and reflecting like a mirror the glory of the Lord. Our heart is like a mirror. Our mind, emotion and will are the main arteries of our heart. Turn our mind to the Lord in our spirit. As we're beholding Him we are being infused with Him. We're reflecting Him to others. The entire Triune God is glory. While we're beholding Him and reflecting Him, we *are being transformed*. Those three words should be our daily, moment by moment experience. *Into the same image* - that word image goes all the way back to Genesis 1:26. From one degree of the Lord Spirit to another degree of the Lord Spirit. This should be taking place within us everyday. Every day we need to receive the abundance of grace. So that grace might reign in you. Grace is God in Christ as the Spirit for our enjoyment. Grace means something that occasions pleasure or delight. That is the Lord to us. We want that enjoyment of grace to reign in us. Christ Himself is the throne of grace in us. We're fully under Him as our Lord, King Head and Husband.

Rev. 22:5, in eternity future, I know your ending. You have a glorious ending, a glorious conclusion.

> The Lord God will shine on them and they will reign for ever and ever.

In Handel's Messiah, it's all scripture. It's not opinion. Handel just took all these verses and put music to them. We know the book of Revelation says *He will reign for ever and ever*. Andrew Yu said the first time the King heard Handel's Messiah the king was listening to this, he will reign for ever and ever, when those in the courts were singing the king stood up. Everyone in the audience stood up. When the king stood up, someone asked the kind after, why did you stand up? The king said, I'm the king, but he's the king of kings. But not only will He reign forever and ever, *we* will reign forever and ever.

**The temple**

1 Kings 8-11. The last item to be put in the temple was the ark of the covenant. When the priests came out of the Holy Place the cloud filled the house of Jehovah and the priests were not able to stand and minister for the glory of Jehovah filled the house of Jehovah. We should pray that.

**Three stages**

1. In the church age Christ sat down at the right hand of God and is now in our spirit as our rest.

Sometimes we can be in the church life we can feel like we're toiling. I'm serving here, serving there. If we ever feel that we're burdened in a wrong way, a caution light should go off in us. Because, "Come to Me all who toil and are burdened and I will give you rest." It's not a small thing to come to Him and ask for rest. It's in His will. He willed Himself as rest to us. "Take your yoke upon you and learn from me for I am meek and lowly of heart and you will find rest for your souls."

Out inward unrest comes from our mind, emotion, will. If we come to Him. it says we need to take His yoke upon us. His yoke. v30, "My yoke is easy, my burden is light." What is His yoke? His yoke is the Father's will. If I'm taking my will upon me, it's not going to be easy. But if I take His will, His yoke is easy. If the Lord commissions me to go somewhere. One time I had this sense, go to Taipei. But I was serving. Ron and I were editors. I said, Lord, how can I leave? I have messages to edit. For me to go, I'd have to call brother Lee. But the Lord wouldn't stop. So I fellowshipped with the other leading brothers and gave brother Lee a call. He said, very good brother Ed, come to Taipei. That was the Father's will. That was something that was not difficult for me. When I went there, it was easy because His yoke was upon me. 

2. Millennial kingdom enjoy rest in a fuller way
3. new heavens and new earth rest in the fullest way to all God's redeemed in eternity.

Jeru-shalom means foundation of peace.

### B. Elimelech swerved from God's economy to a country of idolatry

A contrast here. From Bethlehem, the birthplace of the coming Christ. We don't want to swerve from bringing Christ back. If we experience Christ in the way Naomi and Ruth did, by coming back to the good land, they were in the line of the geneology of life.

### C. Naomi returned to the rest in God's economy

She returned with Ruth, her daughter in law, given to her by God. God gave her a daughter in law and her daughter in law was a Moabitess. Who can imagine that? God already warned the children of Israel about Moab. But if God want to break His rules He can do it. Isn't it wonderful to have a daughter in law given to you by God?

### D. Ruth chose the goal of participating with God's elect

She chose God and His kingdom for the carrying out of God's economy concerning Christ.

Matt. 1:5-6

> Salmon begot Boaz of Rahab

Rahab was a Caananite and a prostitute. She turned to the God of Israel. Rahab's son was Boaz. Boaz was the son of Rahab. Jesus purposely detoured to gain the Samaritan woman. In John 8 He saved an adulterous woman.

> Boaz begot Obed of Ruth

Boaz marries Ruth, a Moabites. They have a son Obed. Obed begets Jessie and Jessie begets David the King, and Christ is the son of David.

Footnote:

> Regardless of who we are and what our background is. As long as we have a heart that seeks God and His people, we are in a position to be accepted into the birthright of Christ.

## III. Chapter 2 of the book of Ruth speaks of Ruth, as one who had returned to God from her heathen background, exercising her right to partake of the rich produce of the inheritance of God's elect

How does Ruth get this right?

### A. threefold status - sojourner, poor one, and widow

### B. God's ordinance was to bless the children of Israel if they left the corner of their fields to these ones

Lev. 23:22; 19:9-10

Deut. 24:19, If you forget a sheath, it's not yours anymore. It's for the sojourner, poor and widow.

### C. Boaz obeyed this ordinance

This ordinance seems to have been written for one person, Ruth.

### D. We also have the right to enjoy Christ

Paul's Christian life was a quest to know Christ. "To know Him" Many years later, "But I pursue, I want to lay hold of that for which I've been laid hold of by Christ Jesus." To seize, to grasp. All of us can testify that all of us have been seized by Christ. He took possession of us. So that we could take possession of Him. Forget the things which are behind. Forget about it. Stretch forward to the vast unexplored territory of the Christ who is before us. Toward the goal, the fullest gaining of Christ. For the prize, the uttermost enjoyment of Christ in the millennial kingdom.

### E. Ruth portrays the way, position, qualification and right for sinners to participate in Christ.

Col. 1:12, qualified by the Father for a share of the allotted portion of the saints in the life. Clear that Paul is referring to the lot of the good land here.

Rev. 22:14, blessed are those who was their robes that they may have the right to the tree of life and enter by the gates into the city. God wants to make you happy (Gen. LS). Wash their robes in the previous blood of Christ. We wash our robes to have the right to eat Him as the tree of life. That causes us to enter by the gates into the city. The gates can signify Christ. So we enter through Christ into the city. You are blessed when you wash your robes, you can exercise your right to eat Christ as the tree of life so you can enter the union with the processed and consummated Triune God.

### F. Four types

1. Boaz typifies Christ, rich in grace
2. The field typifies the Christ the good land, the source
3. Barley and wheat typify Christ as material for making food for God and His people
4. Ruth, a Moabites - a sinner given the right to partake the gleanings of the harvest of God's elect

That Caananite woman came to the Lord and said, Son of David, but she didn't have the position, because only the Israelites had that position. She wanted Him to heal her daughter possessed by a demon. He said it's not right to take the children's food and feed it to the dogs. She didn't get offended. She said, Yes Lord, for even the little dogs eat of the crumbs that fall from their master's tables. 

Book, *Eating the Lord*

>  The Lord didn't say He would heal the daughter. He said He was the bread to feed her. Whenever you have a need, it is a proof you need to eat the Lord Jesus. I am the crumbs for you to eat. Regardless of whether your daughter is sick, eat me. Eat me and your daughter will be healed. When the wives eat Jesus the husbands are better. Whether our circumstances are good or bad, the Lord is for you to eat. You first eat under the table and after a while you eat on the table. When the gentile dogs eat under the table, they become sons.



## IV. Chapter 3 of the book of Ruth speaks of Ruth's seeking for her rest

### A. Naomi sought a resting place for Ruth

Naomi was excited when she heard Ruth was gleaning from Boaz' field. Naomi acted as a middle man.

The genuine ministers of Christ are like Naomi - they stir up the believers in Christ to love Him as their Bridegroom. Paul considered himself someone who had betrothed the believers to Christ.

The only way for us to have rest is to take Christ as our Husband. First thing in the morning say, Lord Jesus I love You.

### B. Ruth still needed a home to have rest - this kind of rest can come only through marriage

To have a home for rest we must marry the Lord Jesus. 

Christ is the house of Jehovah, Psa 90:1, John 2:19; The church is our home; the New Jerusalem will be our home. Tabernacle of God, temple of God.

To apply all of that, our spirit is the house of Jehovah. The church and our spirit. That's practical. Eph. 2:22, the habitation of God is in our spirit. When you're in your spirit you're at home. When you're in the church you should have the feeling you're at home. 

### D. I am a kinsman, yet there is a kinsman closer than I



## V. Chapter 4 of the book of Ruth speaks of Ruth's receiving a reward for God's economy

### A. Now we have a Husband! Who is rescuing us, saving us, delivering us from all our troubles.

Your maker is your husband. And the Holy one of Israel is your redeemer, the God of all the earth.

### B. Ruth redeemed from the indebtedness of her dead husband

The dead husband typifies the old man. Romans 7:2-4. Our old man was our old husband. But God created us to be His wife. We gave Him up and assumed a position of a husband for ourselves. Our old man was crucified with Christ. 

> If the husband dies she is free from the law so that she is not an adulterous if she is joined to another man

Our old husband died. Our new husband is the resurrected Christ. A funeral and a wedding. 

> You also have been made dead to the law that you might be joined to another

### C. Ruth became a crucial ancestor

### D. Ruth continued the line of the God-created humanity for the incarnation of Christ
