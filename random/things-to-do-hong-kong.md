> Tai O Fishing Village on Lantau Island offers a glimpse into Hong Kong’s traditional fishing culture. Known for its stilt houses built over the water, this historic village lets visitors explore a slower side of Hong Kong, away from the skyscrapers and bustling streets. Families can wander the local markets, where vendors sell dried seafood, traditional snacks, and handcrafted goods. A boat ride through the stilt houses gives kids a closer look at the village’s unique architecture and way of life.
