## Questions for the Lord
- what do you want me to have faith in? What do you want me to believe in?
- was what I experienced of peace and power really you or something else?

Maybe the Lord wants me to be more desperate in my prayer. My prayer is so weak, so low. Even though I pour out, there is not much feeling, not much desperation.

> Prod me with you loving hands
> Stir me from my deep impasse
> I want to flee this stagnant rut
> My soul, my prison, deadened lot

Maybe the Lord's training and desire is that I would not be brought under the power or control of anything, including certain parts of my body. Even if the thing itself is not evil, the fact I am controlled by it is. The Lord wants me to be above it, to be over it, to be in control of it, not ruled by it.

> All things are lawful to me, but not all things are profitble, all things are lawful to me, but I will not be brought under the power of anything.

1 Cor 6:12

As our peqce offering He is also the arbitrating one. "let the peace of christ arbitrate in your hearts." as such an arbitrating One, He decides what is right or wrong, life or death, spirit or flesh. its not us. he divides spirit from soul. paul says he doesnt judge himself because the one who judges is God. he judges and decides through peace. his peace is the judge. So I ask the Lord to judge in my heart, 5o arbitrate and decide, by making peqce in my heart.

whether or not i know what this is i know that it persists in me no matter what. its almost similar to my faith in the lord. i do not know if thats positive oe negative but i can only accept that it has persisted through many death experiences.

#### VT msg 12, reward/punishment + lamp in the dark place
- His will, in His way, and at His time
- allowing His authority to touch the depths of our being
- "a lamp shining in a dark place" (2 Pet 1:19) - the Lord as light has to reach the darkest part of our being, even to our abyss, then He will have a lamp in our inward being.
- this is by giving to heed to the prophetic word, which according to the context of vv12-18, includes Christ as "the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ", "that One's majesty", "He received from the Father honor and glory", "This is My Son, My Beloved", "the voice borne out of heaven"
- reading and pray-reading have a marvelous effect of our being. you can read 3 OT and 1 NT to read the whole Bible in a year; you can choose one book and pray-read a few verses every day until you finish the whole book.

#### VT msg 10, kingdom
- the Lord's assignment to me is best for me
- learn to share the same position with Christ. set the mind on the things which are above.
- fight by speaking the Word

#### VT msg 8, warfare
- the blood cleanses us from every sin; when we do not trust the precious blood, we dishonor Him (active faith)
- the word of our testimony to speak "what there is in Christ", His name above e every name, His victory in crushing Satan under His feet
- hate and deny our soul life (with its strength and ability)
- Lord, if You want to cut something out, cut it. if you don't want it, I don't want it

#### VT msg 2, keys of death and hades
- He wants access to the depths of our being
- there is an abyss deep in our being. when you wake up in the morning and many thoughts come ask the Lord, is this thought from You?
- He wants to reach tbe depths of our soul, beyond what we even know. if we give the Lord the ground, the access, the opportunity, the free way to move and act, death and hades will be under His control
- Christ has the keys, the authority, of death and Hades. he is not afraid of death and hades. he has the keys.
