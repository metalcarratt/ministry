# Message Five - Being a fully equiped man of God by inahlling and exhaling the Word of God as the Breath of God
- most of the points come from "Teachers Training"

When we get into the Word we inhale. when we speak for the Lord we exhale. When we speak, veils should be rolled away. We should have the expectation when we speak that veils should be rolled away.
You need to consider and ajust your speaking based on what's happening. Are veils being rolled away?

## I. a man of God with the breath of God
### A. "breathed into his nostrils the breath of life" (HUMAN SPIRIT)
It wasn't the eternal life, but it was still breathed out from God

### B. "receive the Holy Pneuma" (HOLY SPIRIT)

### C. "all scripture is God breathed" (SCRIPTURE)
- 2 Tim. 3:16a, in the full-blown degredation of the church. the co-workers are leaving Paul, the churches are turning away from him. He presents some antidotes. This is one of them.

### D. being a fully equiped man of God *requires* the *exercise of our spirit*, the *continual receiving of the Spirit*, and the *breathing in of God's word*

## II. profitable
- There is profit when we touch His Word, and also an issue

### A. The Bible is God's breath, this breath is the Spirit, and the Spirit gives life

The opening/closing word - is it just a summary of points? Or do we pray? Do we inhale the Word? Do we expect our speaking to be an exhaling of the Word?

A great difference in the way we use the Word of God and how those in Christianity use it. We humble ourselves before the Word to receive light and revelation. May we maintain this great differece.
If the Word just becomes a textbook, where are we headed? Underlying feeling of this message - this touches the essence of the Lord's recovery. How do we interact with the Word of God? Do we humble
ourselves? Or is it our "morning newspaper"? Do the saints sense we are brothers who contact the Word in our spirit? The Word is living to us. It is not a textbook. The essence of the Lord's
recovery is breathing in the Word of God. Touching God as life. The saints follow our example. Are *you* living? Waht do the saints get when *you* speak? Just some points? Or life? Too easy to look
at the saints. What about us? What about *our* contact with the Word on a daily basis?

### B. profit in four matters - teaching, conviction, correction, instruction in righteousness
Four definite matters we can have a profit.

#### 1. Teaching equals revelation - to roll away the veil
Rolling away the veil has to be little by little, gradually.

The order of these points is vitally important. Very tempting to get out of order. What does revelation produce? Conviction.

#### 2. Conviction *comes from* revelation - the more we see God, know God, love God, the more we abhor ourselves and deny ourselves
- Job. 42:5-6

Is it resulting in conviction? If we can read teh Word every day and not be convicted of our shortcomings, mistakes, failures, something is wrong with our reading of the Bible.

#### 3. correction
Here we can really stumble. You see something not right. "I'm going to set them right!' - we just jumped over revelation and conviction and went straight to correction. But they
hadn't seen the Lord. The veil hadn't been rolled away. We have to be wise.

#### 4. instruction in righteousness
Only one with a modifier, 'righteousness'

We can be wrong in so many ways. This is a profit of contacting the Spirit in the scriptures. There is a way to be made right.

### C. The issue - becoming complete
#### 1. Expressing Him
The issue is God is expressed
#### 2. God's breathing produces God-men

## III. slay God's adversary
We are people full of thoughts, feelings, ideas. It's easy for us to be offended. Our fighting is not against flesh and blood. There is an adversary in the air. "Ah the sister is offended, I'll come and strengthen that."
Now the church, the Body, is under attack. How do we help that situation? Where is the protection? In the air, attacking the church. How do you deal with *that* problem? Take the Word by prayer. Which verse will deal with
my emotion? Any verse. All scripture is God breathed. We are not marriage councilors or social workers. We lead the saints to the Word of God. Help the saints touch the Spirit in the Word.
