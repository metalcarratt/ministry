# Message Two - (pattern of joining ourselves to God's purpose) God calling us according to His purpose

Outline:
- I, II. on purpose
- III. on the will of God

When it comes to God's will in this age of grace, there is God's **permissive will**, thing He permits but did not ordain. And His **perfect will**.

## I. saved and called according to His purpose (2 Tim. 1:9)
*(In our service and church life we cannot do much without God's blessing)*

### D. His purpose should become our purpose
- Rom. 8:28, "All things work together for good to those who love God"
To those who **love God as God**. When God functions as God He may give no explanation. We love Him **as God**. Lord, what does it mean to love God? When the sovereign God is allowing something to happen this is God's sovereignty. But I love God.

The meaning of my existence, my purpose in being here, is God's purpose. Seek His grace to be diligent to fulfill whatever He has measured out to us.

### F. Saved from a human life that is meaningless
#### 2. God created a man with great meaning and purpose

"Praise the Lord...for what?" (meaning, if you say "praise the Lord", there should be something you are praising Him *for*).

## II. God's purpose to dispense
### C. God's purpose is to have the church
- Eph. 1:9-11
He sincerely wants this desire of His heart to become the desire of our heart.

### D. the church is the unique means God uses
#### 2. The church is God's greatest boast in making known to the angelic rulers and authorities His multifarious wisdom for the shame and defeat of the enemy to bring in His kingdom
#### 3. heading up all things by working Himself into us as **life and light**
- "heading up" - need to know the church in this aspect
- "life and light" - to what extent has God, who is light, been able to penetrate our being?

## III. know and do the will of God
Not the permissive will but the perfect will.

### A. God is a God of purpose
God's will is the source of all positive things created. His will - that Christ would be everything and the church would be built up. - consecrate for this

^^ with this basis we can ask the Lord what His will is for us in a particular situation

### D. "Not everyone who says to Me, Lord, Lord, will enter into the kingomd of the heavens, but he who does the will of My Father who is in the heavens" (Matt. 7:21)
He is speaking this to us. Don't think He is speaking to religious Christianity. The Lord knows you did these things, but who's will were you following? Was it just your own will? When we stand before the Lord, He may say, that was your will.
We could be doing a "spiritual work" but if we were the source it is a matter of lawlessness.

"You haven't done it because you haven't had the opportunity yet" - Br. Lee.

#### 4. narrow gate and constricted way
If someone is taking the lead are we just quiet and go along? Or do we take everything to the Lord in prayer?

Brothers may come together and all feel good about a certain matter, but is it what the Father wants? We need to bring all things to the Lord. 

##### a. The narrow gate excludes the old man, the self, the flesh, the human concept, and the world with all its glory; only that which corresponds with God's will can enter in
##### b. restricted by a mysterious, invisible, inward control
