# General subject: Being a vessel unto honor, a fully equiped man of God, by being empowered in the grace which is in Christ Jesus to fully accomplish our ministry in the unique ministry of God's economy

This training focuses on 2 Tim. Paul's last, dying word to the church. Particular angle - becoming a pattern to the believers. Paul fed his spiritual children with his own living of Christ. What kind of person are we? The person is the ministry, the person is the message.

# Message One - (a pattern of exercising our spirit) Living in the reality of God's eternal economy for its fulfillment by building up a habit of exercising our spirit, fanning our God-given spirit into flame

"Building up a habit" - perfecting training. Building up a habit of living Christ.

"Exercising our spirit" and "fanning our God-given spirit into flame" are synonymous.

Outline:
- I. vision of God's economy
- II. importance of human spirit
- III. how to livein the reality by exercising our spirit

## I. God's economy
### A. Christ is the center
"hear Him", "Jesus only" - this is God's economy

### B. Entire Bible concerned with God's economy.
- Job.10:3, But You have hidden these things in Your heart / I know that this is with You
- Eph. 3:9, Enlighten all that they may see what the economy of the mystery is.
The key to unlock every book.

Everything that takes place in our life - the answer is God's economy. The Lord wants to open us up. When we pass through certain situations we open up. **The more real we are with the Lord, the more real He will be to us**. God has to tear down Job's natural perfection to re-model him with Himself. Before that Job did not abhor himself until he saw God, and then
he repented in dust and ashes.

### C. God's economy is to dispense
The mind set on the spirit is zoe.

### E. different teachings of dissenting ones cause envy and discord which are contrary to love
Four types of thoughts in 2 Cor:
- Hardened: 2 Cor. 3:14, But their **thoughts being hardened**
- Blinded: 2 Cor. 4:4, In whom the God of this age has **blinded the thoughts** of the unbelievers
- Rebellious: 2 Cor. 10:5, As we overthrow reasonings and **every high thing rising up against the knowledge of God**, and take captive **every thought unto the obedience** of Christ
- Corrupted: 2 Cor. 11:3, ...your **thoughts would be corrupted**

Rather than:
- 2 Cor. 11:3, "the **simplicity** and the **purity** toward Christ

## II. blueprint of God's intention - man's spirit
### B. without God the whole universe is empty
Only when we exercise our spirit does our human life have meaning

### C. men have over-looked, neglected, and refused to admit man has a spirit
The human spirit is an over looked and neglected part of our being

#### 3. central government is spirit - a man who is ruled and controlled by his spirit

### E. mingled spirit
#### 2. The Body is in our spirit
- 1 John 5:4, our spirit, which is a spirit of faith, overcomes the world, "everything that has been begotten of God overcomes the world... our faith"
- 1 John 5:18, in our spirit we cannot sin, "everyone who is begotten of God does not sin"

When we exercise our spirit we are free from self-consciousness and self-righteousness.

## III. key is to exercise our spirit
When you exercise your spirit there is a flame there.

### B. The word exercise implies forcing
The devil can't say praise the Lord, but we can.

### C. to exercise is to fan our spirit into flame
#### 3. Fire is in our regenerated spirit
The fire in our spirit is the impelling force.

### D. Must deal with our soul
#### 4. Establish our souls - establish in our **mind**, to **know and understand** the Lord; establish in our **emotion**, to **love** the Lord; establish in our **will**, to be **strong to remain**, and do things that **please** the Lord.

### F. Set our mind on the spirit
#### 3. Our Christian life is not according to the standard of right and wrong but according to the inner sense of life and peace in our spirit

### I. For the interests of God - Christ, the kingdom, and the house of God
Aim your prayer at the holy land, the holy city, and the holy temple: Christ, the kingdom and the house - when we pray for someone, pray in this way.
