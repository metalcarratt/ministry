# Message Four - Christ nullifying death and bring life and incorruption to light, and our remembering Jesus Christ, the seed of David, raised from the dead

## I. nullified death
- not only overcome or defeat. to make of non effect.

### B. Jesus brought life and incorruption to life through the gospel
**Incorruption**
the consequence of life saturating our being. corruption and deterioration from the original nature. death brings in corruption.

**Life**
Death is the greatest weapon Satan uses to frustrate God's goal. Death ahs been reigning. physically, psychologically, spiritually. life is an essential,
crucial element for the accomplishment of God's economy. An extremely crucial aspect of God's work - to nullify death. Satan is the ruler, the prince of
death. He has the might of feath. Through Christ Satan has been destoryed and the power of death is gone. Where is your sting? your victory?

Be conscious of the matter of death. Don't allow yourself to become an opening for death to come in. Opinions bring in death. Don't allow yourself to
become an instrument for death to pass our from us. How we speak to one another can either caused life to be imparted or death to come out.

**Light**
Satan also brings in darkness and blindness. To experience life the firs step is to be open to experience light. life first come to us as light shining
into our being. Lord, take all the veils away. we hold certain concepts in our mind.

## II. Remember Jesus Christ, raised from the dead, of the seed of David
Rom. 1:34 out of the seed of Daid, designated the Son of God out of the resurrection of the dead. Ref. Samuel.

Did God raise Jesus from the dead, or did Jesus raise Himself? Yes. This indicates His dual status - human and divine.

From this time onward man was there
in heaven. God, in His heart, desired to be joined to man. God' good pleasure. Eventually in incarnation God attained this. Now He is reproducing this in us.

**New**
We are a **new creation**. Don't remain in oldness. You are the resurrection. Today, right now. You are a new creation. Another enemy - oldness.

**Divine**
God put divinity into humanity through incarnation but still that humanity had nothing to do with divinity *until* He passed through death and in resurrection. His
humanity was brought into divinity.
