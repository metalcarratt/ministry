# Message Eight - "Fully accomplish your ministry"
Every member of the Body has ministry

## I. one ministry
### A. "his *portion* of this ministry

### B. 2 Cor. 4:1
You have a portion of Christ unique to you, that on one else has. The only way we can know this portion of Christ is from you,
speaking and ministering. This portion needs to be advanced so you fully complete it.

### C. 2 Cor. 3:6
### 2. constituted with the Triune God
This past year, what has the Triune God been doing to constitute Himself into you? Your being is the ministry. The constitution
in our being brings forth our ministry.

## II. the ministry is also personal
### A. Acts 20:24
#### 2. he ministered his very being to others
There are so many gifted brothers, but Lord, raise up so many brothers fulfilling their part of the ministry. Br. Lee has a list
of things that would deeply concern him when he left. One of them was that we would go back to Christianity.

### E. every member has his own ministry
our eyes have a ministry, our ears and nose have their ministry. The function of the members is their ministry.
