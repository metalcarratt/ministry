# Message Six - Being a vessel unto honor and pursuing righteousness, faith, love, peace with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart
How much we need to be equiped! Elders are, primarily, shepherds. Not just knowledge or ability. Who is the pattern for the saints,
especially the younger saints? This is how we shepherd the saints - with a pattern. What do they see in our lives? Consider before
the Lord how we can be equiped to be patterns.

Two matters: to be open and to be pure.

## I. honourable vessels
Wood, grass, stubble > cheap and worthless materials. The question today is not whether you can speak but whether you have paid a
price. The only words that are honourable and noble are those that have been paid for with a price.

### B. honor, mercy, glory

### C. contain God as honor and glory

### E. open vessel
We may think we are open, but the challenges come. How open are we? Need to be open in a genuine way.

He does not want us to do anything but to love Him and *open up* to Him. Man wants to know and do. The significance of the fall.
Satan injected the desire to be something apart from God. In order for man to be something he needs to know something and do
something. Most evil thing - to know and to do, to be independent. Open more deeply.

## II. pursue
Not a time for passive people, indifferent people.

### B. righteousness

### C. faith
The gospel and the God ordained way should issue out of an oganic union with the Lord, and strengthen and result in more of this
union.

Faith is a matter of this organic union with the Lord.

### D. love
One area of our need to be open vessels, to have honor, is to love the brothers. The matter of forgiveness in love.

#### 1. God sending His Son
Pursue to love God

#### 2. God is love. We love because He first loved us.

#### 3. love others *habitually* with the love that is God Himself

### E. peace
Peace is the issue of the forgoing 3 elements

"My peace I give you. Not as the world gives."

## III. call out of a pure heart
### A. not a new practice
Calling should never be old to us. It is our heritage. When we call we get the Person.

#### 2. Acts 2:21, footnote 1

### B. 2 Tim 2:22
If our calling is not as sweet as it used to be, maybe there is a condition with our heart.

The Lord is operating in all of us to make us pure.

#### 2. a heart fixed on God
Allow the Lord to make His home there.
