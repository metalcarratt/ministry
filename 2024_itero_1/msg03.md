# Message Three - Being empowered in the grace which is in Christ Jesus to be teachers, soldiers, contenders, farmers, and workmen
These are the titles of the innoculator
- "contenders" - athletes

subject of 2 Tim - innoculation against the decline of the church. important for us to be
these 5 titles to stand against the decline of the church. 

Two lines: grace and our spirit. The empowering grace is in and with our spirit. Pattern--"You know what kind of men we were among you."

## I. a remnant who receive mercy from the Lord to remain faithful
Not capable, not eloquent, but faithful. I hope none of us would think "I would never." Lord, we need Your mercy.

### A. Onesiphorus.
Paul was in prison and needed refreshing. Onesiphorus sought him out.

### B. Timothy
A younger one who was willing to be perfected and fully equiped. Like souled. Don't we desire this?

## II. teachers, soldiers, contenders, farmers, workmen
### A. teachers
We need to guard and enrich the good deposit. Our commission - whatever we've received. Pass it on. Seeking to improve our teaching, our presentation of the truth. Opening word. Aspire to do it better. We want to equip the younger ones to teach others also. Paul shepherded each one
with tears and did not withhole anything form them. Paul was not writing the Bible when he wrote the epistles (it later *became* the Bible), he was shepherding. And his writing is full of teaching. Full of teaching, but so nourishing.

We need to give the saints the taste of life. This taste of life equips the saints to block the destroyers. They will have the taste to discern life from death.

7 kinds of destroyers:
1. wind of divisive teachings, stressing things other than God's economy
2. heresies
3. factious, sectarian
4. make divisions
5. ambitious for position
6. wolves
7. perverted things to draw believers after them.
I hope we would not receive this for anyone else. Lord, have mercy on us.

Zech. 11:7, two staffs for shepherding: favour and bonds; grace and oneness

Our teaching may draw the saints away by a different stress. Even the work with the children, young people, and the God ordained way are part of the leaves and branches, not the trunk. Let us not build a "high place" that competes with the trunk by an improper stress on these things.

### B. soldiers
Every time we go to minister hrist we are in a warfare.

#### 1. ministry sounding of trumpet
1 Cor. 14:8, if the trumpet gives an uncertain sound, who will prepare himself for battle?

not just vs negative things but different teachings.

speaking in tongues was a *stress* that gave an uncertain sound. Not heretical or even wrong.

#### 2. to fight must clear away all earthly entanglements
Untangle me!

#### 3. fight against death
Do we have the realiseation how ugly is spiritual death? Relatives and sudden death. Loose talk, criticism, concern. Dont be open to it, even if it's someone we respect.

#### 4. our will
exercise a spirit of power

### C. contenders, atheletes
Must content lawfully, and must exercise self control.
- never loose
- never make excuses
- never consider yourself an exception
Especially in the matters of lust for sex and money.

### D. farmers
- "His healthy words"

A farmer is all day long, every day, wrapped in life. Helping things grow We don't help the little seedlings grow by pulling them up. SOmetimes brothers get impatient. It doesn't help. Know well the condition of our flocks and hers. need to know not only the word and the ministry
but also the hearts of the saints.

#### 1. The word of God, as a grain of wheat to nourish; a fire and a hammer to purify
We don't "hammer" the self of the saints. We minister the Word to the saints. They take that word to the Lord and He is the hammer to their self.

#### 2. rain and snow

### E. workmen cutting straight the word of the truth
It may be the ones Paul told Timothy to charge not to teach different things were older than him. "Do not upbraid an elderly man". Timothy required love, wisdom and purity to do this.
