# Message Seven - The Lord being with our spirit to be our empowering grace, enabling us to minister the healthy teaching of God's eternal economy, speaking with healthy words of the grace of life for the organic building up of the church as the Body of Christ
Paul wasn't discouraged despite the declining of the church. He knew the unchangeableness of God. IN our history some have been with us and have left. This is the age of degredation.
Need to stand firm. Many faithful senior saints have gone to be with the Lord. In the last two decades around 20. Thank the Lord many young ones are rising up to serve. Burdened for
the youger serving saints, that this testimony can be preserved and maintained. Much prayer and fellowship for our next generation. For our younger brothers. So many to learn not only
the words but also the ways. If you can, wath some of the videos (of Brother Lee speaking). Don't ust listen to the words. Watch how he spoke, his ways.

## I. grace
### A. grace as the unsearchably rich capital
My spirit is as great as the heavens and the earth (Zech). And the Lord is with my spirit. I can locate God. We should not be a mental Christian. We should be fanning our spirit
into flame.

### B. saving grace, empowering grace, ever-present grace

## II. 1 Cor. 15:45, 2 Cor. 3:17, 2 Tim 4:22
- verses that should be hung on our wall every day.

Don't try to find Him in your mind or in your emotions. Exercise your spirit.

## III. Grace is the circulating Triune God.
Perfected, strengthened, grounded and established.

### A. First case of grace is God's incarnation
#### 1. Mary graced by God, He came to visit her, He entered into he, stayed in her, to be the very essence of her conceiving a wonderful Person
Luke 1:28

"You have been graced." Now God is going to come into you. In the OT God visitng man many times, but He never stayed with them. But here He came
to a little virgin and stayed with her, entered into her and became the very essence of he conceiving a wonderful Person. True grace as revealed
here is God coming to us, staying with us, entering into us. This is grace.

- Song of Songs - at the beginning the lover is a horse, at the end she is leaning on her beloved.
- Jacob - at the beginning full of schemes, at the end leaning on his staff

#### 2. stay in us, be born in us, be one with us, even become us
Not I but the grace

### B. Grace is the wonderful Christ

#### 2. dispensed into us
##### a. Heb 4:16
We all have needs. We need to find grace for our timely need. Grace can take care of all our lacks. Our shortages can only be filled by God's grace.

##### b. When we cannot do anything, when we are not able to move, and when we have no strength, that is the time to trust in and enjoy the supply of God as grace
Leaning on her beloved. Attained such a level of spirituality but now utterly dependant on the Lord.

The more we grow and mature the more dependant we become and the less confident we are. Jacob leaning on his staff - a picture of how God had been leading him his whole life.

#### 3.a.
Grace is the real burden bearer.

## IV. guard the good deposit
Today its not a matter of receiving more deposit. You need to guard it. Don't allow it to leak out of for us to drift away. If our conscience is seared there will be a leaking out.

### B. Hold a pattern
Aspire to be a proper pattern.
