The way we apply the ministry in practice needs to be with the help of the ministry, but through the prayer and coordination to know how to apply it in our present situation.

The book "practical points concerning blending" is brother lees response after asking the lord what his ministry should be and receiving the revelation that he should focus on the body of christ.

Not just quoting a person, "brother lee said". Say, "the bible says". Do we have confidence what we are quoting is the revelation of the bible?

If the self is renounced then you have the body.

Book of 1 cor is actually an expounding of the history of the children of israel from exodus, through the wilderness to the good land. Their journey is a type of our journey as the church.

Three kinds of food:
- the word of god
- doing the will of God
- the anakim.

The intrinsic essence of coordination is blending.

To walk in Christ as the good land is to walk in the Body-Christ. Col. 2:6, walk in "the Christ" is the same as "the Christ" in 1 Cor. 12:12, "all the members of the body, being many, are on body, so also is the Christ."

Jehovah turned the captivity of Job when he prayed for his friends (Job 42:10)
