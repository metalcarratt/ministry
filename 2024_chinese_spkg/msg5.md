# Message 5 - receiving the kingdom reward of christ as the crown of righteousness

the lords appearing is also his appearing and manifestation to us today.



our christ is forever new. the devil will tell us we don't love the lord, but we need
to cast him out. lord, I love you! the lord wants to meet our every need. but we need
to love him. May we have a new beginning where we are just loving the lord.

## kinds of lovers
four kinds of lovers: lovers of self, lovers of money, lovers of pleasure, lovers of god.

what kind of lovers are we? the root of the church's decline was the loss of her first
love toward the lord. 1 John 4:16, He who abides in love abides in God. 1 John 4:16-21.
two directions: loving the world, the self. or, love christ with our first love. this
also includes loving one another. v20, a practical way to gain christ as our first
love is to love the saints, to love one another. deal with anything that comes in to
cause us to hate our brother. Fellowship, circulation, has an interesting way of
bringing healing to the damaged parts of the body. the truth is, he who cannot
love his brother can not love God. we need to deal with our hearts, especially
concerning the saints.

## embroidered work
II. B. 2. c-e on the embroidered work of the subjective christ - we need to muse over
these points to consider what they mean.

> c. the raiment of embroidered work is the su receive christ woven into our character, embroidered into our being, to be our lived out righteousness.
>
> d. this embroidery signifies the transforming work of the holy spirit, who is working day by day to embroider christ into us stitch by stitch to be our wedding garment.
>
> e. the degraded recovered church needs to pay the price to live christ as her subjective righteousness that she may be clothed with christ as he God approved
> conduct.

the Lord is not so interested in an outward work. our disposition, our character,
needs to be touched.

## crown of righteousness
the heavenly kingdom equals the crown of righteousness.
