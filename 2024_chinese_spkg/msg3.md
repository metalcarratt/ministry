# Message 3 - Keeping the faith

## knowing our destiny
a girl who is betrothed knows what her destiny is. she will not pay attention
to other things but to her dear bridegroom. the ministry is a bride preparing
ministry. the burden of this ministry is to prepare the bride. to make us ready.
every LD we partake of the bread and the cup "until He comes". do you have this
in you? declare the lords death until he comes. we don't know how many times we
will need to break bread before the lord comes back, but we know that each time
we break bread it will be one time less.

## awaiting the lords coming
ME Barber. no trace of thought of remaining on the earth. "perhaps I will meet
the Lord when we turn this corner." expecting the lords return as she is walking
down the street. read the passages of the lords coming to the new ones as soon
as they are saved so they will become those who await, even hasten, his return.

## objective and subjective faith
objective faith - those items relating to Christ's person and work

healthy words, healthy teaching, healthy speaking >> ministers reality to people. ministers godliness into us. when the divine reality is ministered into us it produces in us a living of godliness.

word > spirit > faith. the word is the objective faith. the spirit operates on the word to become subjective faith in us.

## conscience
conscience is to preserve us as a test and a check.

holding faith and a good conscience - guard from shipwreck concerning the faith. our conscience as a check. should be able to tell if you are in faith or not.

a conscience purified from any mixture. here it is not sin but mixture. in our living we are *purely* holding the faith. when we serve in the church, how do we serve? are we serving according to the mystery of the faith?

oneness of faith depends on full knowledge of the Son of God - needs to be subjective.
