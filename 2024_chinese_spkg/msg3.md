# Message 3 - Keeping the faith

a girl who is betrothed knows what her destiny is. she will not pay attention
to other things but to her dear bridegroom. the ministry is a bride preparing
ministry. the burden of this ministry is to prepare the bride. to make us ready.
every LD we partake of the bread and the cup "until He comes". do you have this
in you? declare the lords death until he comes. we don't know how many times we
will need to break bread before the lord comes back, but we know that each time
we break bread it will be one time less.

ME Barber. no trace of thought of remaining on the earth. "perhaps I will meet
the Lord when we turn this corner." expecting the lords return as she is walking
down the street. read the passages of the lords coming to the new ones as soon
as they are saved so they will become those who await, even hasten, his return.
