# Fighting the good fight, finishing the course, keeping the faith, and loving the Lord's appearing in order to receive the reward of Christ as the crown of righteousness

## Message 1 - fighting the good fight
"solemnly charge you before God and Christ Jesus" 

... **not** "different teachings" - not just heretical, distractions from the central line. God's economy, the dispensing of christ. the divine life wants to grow, wants to increase.

... **then** "I have fought the good fight."

proper christian life threefold:
- fighting the good fight
- running and finishing the course
- keeping the faith

positively is the economy of god, negatively is different teachings. be faithful to God's economy 

## dependence
we are very self sufficient in our human life. in his sovereign care things will come to cause us to realise, I need the Lord. "apart from me you can do nothing." the test comes, we live in a self sufficient way. even in this we miss the mark. tree of life - dependence. the fall was an injection of self reliance.

## concerning God's economy
battle. the struggle is over the question of gods economy. that we would cooperate in a full way.

## battle
no room for passivity. to really live christ we need to stand and come back to gods economy. the battle starts in us.

the incentive to the inoculator. why enter the battle? what's in it for me? the crown of righteousness.

make his home in our heart

## eternal life
the eternal life is the pre-requisite to enter into the fight.

the eternal life is a person.

## sense of life
how so we "lay hold on" experientially? the book *knowledge of life*, chapter *the sense of life*. the sense of life guides us into the experiences of life. the mind set on the flesh is death, the mind set on the spirit is life and peace. become more acutely aware of the sense of life. unhappiness, anger, depression, discouragement are the sense of death. learn to trust the sense of life. this sense is Christ Himself teaching us to trust life.

lay hold on this divine life and not trust in our human life.

## fight
overthrowing the devils strongholds, taking captive man's thoughts unto the obedience of christ. learn to pray prayers personally and corporately against the devil. pray the prophetic word.

bear the responsibility. we are passive, lazy by nature, but these are the days to be properly aggressive.
