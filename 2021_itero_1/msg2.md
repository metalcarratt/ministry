# Message 2 - The factor of closely following the completed vision of the age through the ministry of the age

A lot of the Lord's ministry was personal, one on one. He had a vital group meeting in the house of Simon the leper. Mary, Martha and Lazarus are there. There was this small group who were lovers of Jesus. That meeting made it into the eternal record of the Word of God. The life and work of eternity - shepherding. Rev - the Lamb in the midst of the throne will shepherd them and bring them to waters of life. That's in eternity. It's a lamb - a young sheep - that will shepherd all the sheep. He came down to everyone's level and that's how He was in the gospels.

Messages in the book the *Vision of the Age*. We are receiving the completed vision of the age.

## I. Every age has a vision of that age and we need to serve God according to the vision of the age we are in

**One vision**

Only one window on the Ark, toward the heavens. Only one revelation and one vision through one ministry.

If you were at Noah's time you would have to get involved with Noah. What the Lord was doing at *that* time was building the Ark. If I had been there and built a speedboat in my backyard, that would be ridiculous. It would go under the water. Noah had the ministry of the age in that age. With Adam, Enosh, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Joseph. With each one, they had a particular work that God wanted them to carry out.

**An all-inheriting vision**

Also, the ministry of one age included all the ministries that went before it. Even the Lord Jesus Himself, who had the vision and the ministry of the age, he entered into the vision of the age of the person before Him (John the Baptist) and allowed him to baptise Him. If I were Him I would have said, step aside John, I'm God. He didn't do that. He entered into the ministry of the age and got baptised by John. Throughout church history the church became degraded and then it began to be recovered. Martin Luther, Zinzendorf, Moravians, John Nelson Darby. With each step the vision got broader and broader, deeper and deeper, higher and higher.

**The consummate vision**

Today we have a central vision, the vision of God's eternal economy. When I wake up in the morning I *must* spend time with the Lord. "Lord, dispense Yourself into me. And I want to be one with You to dispense You into others." Most of our fellow believers don't know the meaning of being a Christian. What is the meaning of being a believer in Christ? It is to be a vessel to contain Him, be filled with Him and overflow Him to others. And to be transformed and glorified in our body to be the Body of Christ, the Bride of Christ and the New Jerusalem as the wife of Christ forever and ever.

Whenever I prepare to share a message I start with myself. Lord, I don't see this. I don't see what brother Lee is saying here. Lord, show me this. In this message I spent so much time on this point because of this. I'm just so thankful that we can be under the vision of the age. And it includes what all the preceding brothers and sisters saw. But we have come to the consummate item that includes every item. We have come to the vision of the New Jerusalem, and the New Jerusalem is the embodiment, the reality of God's economy.

Acts 26:19 - Paul gave his testimony to King Agrippa. "Therefore King Agrippa I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision." I have an aspiration that we would all be able to say this. I shared two messages on being obedient to the vision of the age, because that's what we all want.

#### A. We can be in one accord because we have one vision - an "all inheriting vision"

**to me for you**

Eph. 3:9 - to enlighten all to see the divine economy. v2, the stewardship given to me for you. With God it's His economy. When His economy is entrusted to us it becomes our stewardship. So we want to become good stewards of the varied grace of God. A steward is someone who dispenses food to the members of the household. If the master comes back and finds you giving them food at the appointed time. This is the divine dispensing to the household of God. This grace of God is *to me, for you*. The first thing in our consciousness in the morning should be "to me". You can only dispense the Triune God into people because you have had the Triune God dispensed into you. So these four words are big big points. We have to enjoy the Triune God in His divine dispensing *for others*. You brothers are enjoying the Lord for *my* sake. 

*oikos* and *nomos* - household and administration.

**speak, think the same thing**

1 Cor. 1:10 - I beseech you to speak the same thing. When we come together to a meeting we speak the same thing, from different angles. "be attuned in the same mind" - what is the same mind? Phil. 2.2, think the one thing. The one thing is the subjective knowledge and experience of Christ.

#### B. The entire Bible is an explanation of the eternal economy of God - the governing vision of the Bible is God dispensing Himself into His chosen people that they may be the same as He is.

#### C. Lee -> Nee, "even if you do not take this way I will take this way."

You must read that book, *The Vision of the Age*. 

There are certain churches not intrinsically in the Lord's recovery, because of a certain person. That means the saints there were taking this way because of a person.



## II. The all-inclusive vision of the New Jerusalem

Every feature and experience of God's economy can be seen in the New Jerusalem.

#### A. The NJ is the total composition of the entire revelation of the Bible.

We serve God not according the last "scene" alone, but all the "scenes" that came before it as well.

#### B. Living out the NJ is to become the NJ and working out the NJ is to build the NJ.

The work of the Lord is to work out the New Jerusalem.

When you drink the water that He gives it will *become* in you a fountain of water. Brothers, there is a fountain of water in our spirit. That refers to God the Father. He's the fountain of water. This fountain is springing up. That's Christ the Son. Then you have the river. That's the Spirit. In the New Jerusalem, as the constituents of the Bridge we will always be drinking fresh supply of the Spirit.

#### C. Every local church and believer is a miniature NJ.

When people come to me and see me do they see the features of the New Jerusalem?

#### D. NJ is embodiment of God's judicial and organic salvation.

Isa 42:6, 49:6-8. I encourage you to read the footnotes on those verses. Christ is a covenant to us. He is light to us. As a covenant and a light He is our complete salvation.

God's salvation has two aspects, judicial and organic. As our covenant Christ is for our justification. Approved by God according to His standard of righteousness. As a light to us he is organic salvation because John speaks of the light of life. Christ as our righteousness is the base of our salvation. Based on that we can enjoy the resurrected Christ as the light of life for our organic salvation.

The New Jerusalem has the appearance of a rainbow. This signifies God's faithfulness in keeping His word. Brothers, we are becoming a rainbow. His Word is based on His righteousness. The base of the New Jerusalem is God's righteousness.

The consummation of that is life - the tree of life, the river of life.

Psa. 89:14 - righteousness is the foundation of God's throne. God is on the throne which is the lamp shininig as the light of life, and what flows out of that throne is the river of life with the tree of life on both sides of the river.

#### E. Our experience of God's salvation brings us up level by level to become beings in the New Jerusalem.

In each step/level, the Spirit has a different title.

- regenerated - becoming God's species, God's children, for God's sonship. The generating Spirit in our spirit.
- sanctification - become holy as the holy city. The sanctifying Spirit.
- renewed - our mind becomes as new as the New Jerusalem. The renewing Spirit.
- transformed - constituted with gold, silver (pearl) and precious stones. The transforming Spirit.
- conformed - God's image to have the appearance of the New Jerusalem. The maturing Spirit.
- glorified - permeated with the glory of the New Jerusalem. The sealing Spirit. Eph. 4:30 - we are sealed unto the day of redemption, the day when our body is redeemed which is the glorification of our mortal body.



## III. To live and work out the NJ is to live and work out God's complete salvation

Incarnation, inclusion, intensification. This is also the New Testament ministry.

#### A. The ministry of the Spirit - inscribing us with the ink - the highest peak of the divine revelation.

The New Jerusalem is a great letter of Christ to the whole universe. When Christ ministers the Spirit that is the ink, but what is written is Christ. The Spirit is the ink, Christ is the realisation of the ink. The ministers of the new covenant are ministers of the Spirit.

We are being Christified. 

#### B. The ministry of righteousness - embroidering Christ into our being as our wedding garment - the God-man living. 

The city of New Jerusalem will be filled with righteousness as we are filled with Christ as our subjective righteousness. Righteousness will dwell in the new heaven and new earth.

The power of grace makes us right with God, with ourselves and with one another. It subdues sin and overcomes Satan.

#### C. The ministry of reconciliation - reconciling the world to Christ and the believers to Christ - shepherding people according to God.

God in Christ was reconciling the world to Himself - for the unbelievers. God has put in us the word of reconciliation. We are ambassadors, as God entreats you through us, we beseech you on behalf of Christ, be reconciled to God. He didn't want there to be any distance between them and God, he wanted to bring them all the way into the Holy of Holies.

Psalm 22 - Christ's deed in His redeeming death. Psalm 24 - Christ coming as the King to receive His kingdom. Between is Psalm 23 - Christ as our shepherd.

The name of the city from that day shall be "Jehovah is There".
