# Message 4 - The factor of authority in the Body of Christ and in the local churches

We can do everything correctly in the local church but in the end it is all meaningless if Christ cannot get His desire. 

The vital factor in message 4 is the factor of authority in the Body of Christ and in the local churches. This message is about the awesome responsibility of the elders, co-workers and leading ones - any saints bearing responsibility - to properly represent the authority of God. We should come poor in spirit, not denying what we have seen and learned, but letting it go, coming to the Lord like little children to learn and see.

Five major sections. First four sections are a number of crucial and important matters. But most of the weight of the burden of this message is on the fifth section. Something that will be new to almost all of us. We will start with something foundational about God being the supreme authority. Then we will see after the resurrection of the Godman Jesus, all authority in heaven and earth has been given to Him. No-one else on the earth has authority apart from Jesus. The Son of Man is the Lord of the universe. But this authority must be carried out through the local churches as expressions of the Body. Finally, the source of all of the authority that is in the Body and the church is the throne of God and of the Lamb. Out of this throne the river of water of life is flowing. That is the way our God brings authority into the Body and into the Church. That throne revealed in Rev. 21 and 22 is not only the center of the NJ, but the center of the church life and the Christian life.



## I. God is the supreme authority. He has all authority.

God's authority is God Himself. Authority issues out from God's own being. Only God is this. It flows out of Him.

All authority derives from God. There will be deputy authority. There is in society, in the government. But it all derives from God.

Knowing authority is an inward teaching. We all need an inward personal revelation.

The Lord was a man under authority. The centurion said, "I also am a man under authority." The Lord lived as a man under the authority of the Father and gave up His life. This wonderful man is within us to see what authority is and to let Him live in us the life of obedience.

Anyone representing God in authority can only do so in resurrection. This is why the Lord is working in so many lives so we can all, either in the millennial kingdom, or in the new heaven earth can serve as co-kings with Christ.

He *is* the ruler of the kings of the earth. We are not rebellious on earth but we have access to the highest authority.



## II. Christ is the head corporately of the church and individually of the members

This is a crucial point for all of us. Don't look around for someone to tell you what to do, to direct your life. He is the Head directly of every one of us. All my fingers act directly from the command of the head. They do it in and with the body, but every member is directly under the head.

This is why we need a personal and direct contact with the Lord. What He leads us to do we will carry out in and with the Body. But the command comes directly from Him. We are to help one another to contact the Lord directly. When we had to make a very serious decision and sought brother Lee he never gave any direct advice except to say, pray, seek the Head, honour the Head.

One characteristically of knowing and seeing the Body is discerning if another brother or sister can know or see the Body. Many think they know the Body because they know the doctrine, because they live in the local church.

The Body is the criterion, the standard. The Body knows if we are submitting to the Head. If one doesn't care for the Body, it doesn't matter who you are, do we really care for the Body? More than our self? Even more than our particular local church.

As members of the Body we also submit to the deputy authorities, but they do so because they realise this is the authority of the Head through those ones. The Lord sent Ananias to Paul to bring him into the church. Right from the beginning Paul met the authority of the Body directly from the Head and the members of the Body. We are surrounded by brothers and sisters. We sense something from the members which is the leading of the Head through the Body.



## III. The order of the church comes out of the authority in the church - the honouring of the unique headship of Christ

We need to know the difference between order and organisation. The placement of our eyes on our body is not random, they are in order. Some confuse order with organisation. Decades ago one brother was invited to serve a decade a week, so there was an arrangement on how to serve. He gave a testimony that organisation was creeping into the church. He didn't realise there was order. You don't just come in and do what you want.

There must be order. We are not the source of this order. You might be dispositionally an ordered person. Is it not a shame that there is a kind of organisation and some think this is the Body? But at the same time, when everything is in order we feel so peaceful.



## IV. In the church God's authority is expressed and represented by the apostles and elders

Gen 1:26 - let us make man in our image according to our likeness. And let them who have My image have my dominion. First someone expresses God. That gives that one the ground to represent God. One time Moses failed to express God and he came under God's governmental judgement.

First care for the person and then the problem. Too many times you realise as you care for the person you can't care for the problems. But time and time again the person says it doesn't matter anymore, after receiving the care they can take care of the problem themselves.



## V. There is a divine government in the church life today and this government comes from the throne of God and of the Lamb

What should be the position of the throne of God and of the Lamb in the church life, in the work, in the ministry, and in our personal Christian life? It must be the center. We have a sign of the New Jerusalem. Many of the characteristics were described in chapter 21 but in chapter 22 is the river of water of life, bright as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb, in the middle of its street. This throne is the center of the New Jerusalem. I would suggest you lay this before the Lord and ask, Lord, is the throne the center of my life? I serve with these brothers in my locality. Is the throne the center here? We may have the throne on the perimeter, on the outside. It needs to be in the center of our being. The only thing worthy of utterance, of receiving, is the river of water flowing out of any one of us. I had the honour of editing the life studies. Every message a river flowed. It was so clear who on the earth a more proper representative of God's authority. In God's eyes such a person is more important than any president. In 1977 a famous theologian was asked to give some lectures. The weekend before brother Lee called many of us to ask what we should do about this. He made a suggestion, but did so in the way of fellowship. Eventually what he did was different, but based on the fellowship. Someone had the concept, brother Lee is the minister of the age, you just listen and salute. But that wasn't his being. There was a river flowing. He was asking for fellowship.

Only by submitting to the throne can be share the flowing of His grace.

Hymn 984. River of living water, river that flows from the throne, fellowship giving and making God's own authority known.

If a river is not flowing, it doesn't matter who you are, how active you are or have been, there is no throne here. No-one reacts, no-one judges. The brother is put there by the Lord, we honour and respect. But we're not blind. Some have come deeply troubled because they want to obey. I can only minister life to such ones.

Grace and authority are one. There are dear brothers who separate the throne from the river. They give the word and think, "that's it." The recipient doesn't want to rebel but realise, no grace, no river flowing. The kingdom of God is righteousness, peace and joy. Being under the throne is a realm of indescribable enjoyment.

Hymn 847. I long for fellowship in Spirit. That mingled with the saints I'll be. Longed to be saved from independence and to be built with saints in Thee.

There's a deep longing in my heart for the real fellowship. Everything is real. And in this way we know authority. If the river is not flowing there is not the genuine representation of authority.
