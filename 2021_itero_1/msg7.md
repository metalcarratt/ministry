# Message Seven - The factor of blending for the reality of the Body of Christ

The matter of blending and the matter of the Body of Christ. I-III will address the reality of the Body of Christ. IV is on the blending. V is a conclusion to apply these two matters.

## I. The highest peak in God's economy is the reality of the Body of Christ; the reality of the Body of Christ is absolutely organic

God's economy is the central focus of the whole Bible. Concerned with God's plan to dispense Himself into His chosen people to be their life and everything that God can be one with them and they one with Him for His expression in the universe. He carried this economy out by becoming a man, becoming flesh, living for 33 1/2 years, going to the cross, being resurrected and becoming the Spirit of reality to enter into His believers to begin to make them God in life and nature but not in the Godhead. The result of all this is an organism, a divine-human constitution which we call the Body of Christ. We say this is the highest peak of the divine revelation.

The reality of the Body of Christ is not a figure of speech or a type but really the Body of Christ.

Many Christian know the Body of Christ refers to the Church. Many pastors try to organise the church. But the Body of Christ is absolutely organic. It is something of life and in life. Organic means something of life, something full of life. It is not something of a system of man. It must be fully something organic. This life is not the human life, not the psychological life. We are referring to the eternal divine uncreated life of God.

#### A. Completing ministry of Paul focused on the Body of Christ

Only the epistles of Paul mentioned the Body of Christ, and only in four of them, Romans, 1 Corinthians, Ephesians and Colossians. In the New Testament these four books are crucial. If you took away these four books you would see a void in the New Testament. In Paul's ministry, which he said is a completing ministry, his focus is not on salvation or being spiritual, but to reveal to God's children the matter of the Body of Christ.

The ultimate item is the Body of Christ. After creating the heavens and earth and all the life in it, on the sixth day He created a man in His image with His likeness. This is where God rested. Man is the highest item of His creating work. How about it His redemptive work? In coming to be crucified, His many work was not just to redeem man from sin. The main item is to build the church, to create one new man, which is the one Body. On the cross He created one new man. Eph. 5, Christ loved the church and gave Himself up for her. Christ's redemptive work did not stop at redeeming man from sin. The ultimate item of His redemptive work is to produce the church, which is His Body. How about His building work? At the end of the Bible we see the finality of God's building work, which is the New Jerusalem, the building of God and man, the ultimate expression of the Body of Christ. So whether in His creating, redemptive or building work, the Body is the ultimate item.

Not just in revelation but also in God's move. Over 2000 years of church history, after the time of Martin Luther was the recovery of justification by faith, the inner life, evangelism, a holy living. But not until the time of the British Brethren under Darby, the matter of the church as the Body of Christ was revealed. In the last 2000 years it is not until just over a hundred years ago this matter was made manifest, revealed. Before this the matter of the church was not stressed or realised. After God visited China and raised up brother Nee, he minstered concerning the matter of the church and in the last part of his ministry in 1939, he ministered concerning the Body of Christ. His co-worker brother Lee ministered concerning Christ and the Church. In the last ten years of his ministry life, he stressed the matter of the organic Body of Christ. Even in 1994, a few years before he went to be with the Lord, he prayed to consider what he should minister. The Lord touched him concerning two things: 1) the Body of Christ and the life of the Body of Christ and 2) the reality of the life of the Body of Christ.

Here we are, a hundred years since the time brother Nee was raised up. The burden is still here with us. This is truly a vital factor that needs to be recovered. This is a top point, not only in revelation and seeing, but in our practice. We need to preach the gospel, do many good works, expound the word to feed God's children. But the ultimate burden with us, passed on from our brother Lee, not yet completed, is this matter of seeing the Body, building up the Body, consummating the Body in reality. This is the most valuable, blessed work that God is yet to accomplish through us before this age ends.

#### B. Rom 12 speaks of the Body from the angle of the organic union

Verse 5, "We who are many are one Body in Christ." After speaking about justification, transformation, sanctification. He said we who are many, those who have been through these things, we are one Body in Christ. Not just one Body, one Body *in Christ*. We are not one Body by any other means. Not by association. We are one Body *in Christ*.

"in Christ" is a matter of the organic union. These two words are not easy to understand because we are talking about in a living person. We can understand "in a building" or "in a car" but how do we understand "in a person"? How can XX be in me? He can be with me or by me, but he cannot be in me. But there the Bible stresses again and again that we are those who are "in Christ".

The best illustration is the grafting of two trees. Through the process of grafting, one tree gets into another. In that union something intrinsic goes on. The life of one flows into another. There is a mutual life penetration between the two trees. They are not just bound together, tied together, there is an organic union causing them to live, to become one tree. This is a marvelous illustration in nature to show the organic union. We are the wild olive trees one day grafted into Him. Now there is an organic union.

We are members of one another. This is what the Body of Christ is. It is in Christ, in this organic union, and we are members one of another. This is how we live in the Body of Christ.

We must know what this eternal life is, abide in and continually enjoy this life. He is the vine, we are the branches. The reality of this vine with the many branches can only be realised when the branches abide in the vine and he life in the vine flows into all the branches and between all the branches.

Doctrinally and theoretically we are in the church, but when we are not enjoying this life, at that moment, we are not in the Body. At most we are a sinner saved by grace. The requirement here is so high. Requires us to constantly abide in Him, remain in Him. It is possible to remain in Him because of the life-giving Spirit. We have the secret today of how to abide in Him in a practical way. But when we are not abiding in Him we are outside the organic union and we are not practically the Body of Christ.



## II. The Lord's recovery is for the building up of the Body of Christ; thus, to know the Body is the proper recovery of the Lord.

This Body is still at an infant stage. It does not just come about at its full stature. The Lord said in Matt. 16, I will build by church. The church needs to be built up. The Body of Christ needs to be built up. If you consider church history, who talked about the Body? Who cared about the Body? This was neglected, ignored, buried. Until the time of Darby who began to speak on it and brother Nee and Lee who continued and expanded. Among us, we began to see this, began to speak this, began to be burdened about this. The Body does not just come about in its full stature. The Body right now is still in a very infantile stage. Who would care about this Body? How to raise up this child? To become a full-grown man?

Brother Nee spoke to brother Lee, "I have the blueprint of the building of the church in my hand." Brother Lee asked him in detail and he explained. He said,

1. The element of this building must be uniquely Christ Himself. This building cannot be built with anything of man.
2. The building must be on the proper ground, the ground of oneness that we practiced. It is not in the heavens somewhere. It must be practically somewhere on earth.
3. The building must be carried out in coordination.

These three points constitute the blueprint. That word was spoken over 80 years ago. The blueprint was given to our brother, and brother Lee faithfully followed that. He went to the north and practiced according to that and a great revival was brought about. But another 70+ years since then. How much more building of this Body has taken place.

We need to see how important this matter is.

#### A. The church takes the Body as its organic factor

I am concerned we don't have a clear seeing of what the Body is. We have the practical matters of the church life, but how many saints have truly seen? The church must take the Body of Christ as its organic factor.

The church is an outward framework. The Body is the intrinsic content. Without the Body the church is lifeless and a mere human organisation. If the spirit and soul is removed from a person what is left? An outward shell. A body lying in a coffin. The members are all intact but the spirit and soul are no more.

#### B. Without the Body the church makes no sense and has no meaning

#### C. Love covers and builds up

This seems to be a change but actually it's not. If we want to build up this organism, the unique way, the most excellent way is the way of love. Love is not more passionate or compassionate to one another. Love is the inner substance of God. God is love. Love is God Himself. Knowledge puffs up, love builds up. Love is the expression of life. The flowing out of God's live is love. Love is God being experienced and enjoyed by us. We can only build the church as the Body of Christ by this love.

#### D. The elders should shepherd and love one another to be models of the Body life

Now we also need to practice this love. If we are enjoying this life intrinsically there should be an outflow, an expression, of love for one another.

#### E. We should allow Christ to make His home in our heart

Love is the expression of life. How do we enjoy this life? Every day we need to pray this prayer, Father grant me to be strengthened into my inner man that Christ may make His home in my heart through faith.  Only in this way can the Body of Christ be built up.

#### F. The Lord urgently needs the Body expressed; without this the Lord will not return

What is the governing factor of the Lord's coming back? The governing factor is the Bride making herself ready. There has to be something worthwhile for the Lord to come back for. A substantial expression of the Body that He can call "My Bride".

Time is passing faster and faster, but how much of the Body is being built up? How much reality is here among us? Within the 0.1% of the Lord's children, how many of us are caring for this crucial matter?

#### G. The Lord needs the overcomers

There is no other way. The general condition will not meet this need. Not the "strong" or "elite" one. The overcomers are those who know the Body, live and work for the Body. The Lord needs a special group of Christians today. Who are overcomers. Who live not for themselves. Not for their spiritual work. Not for their "church" work. They live for the Body. For the bringing forth of the Body.

The overcomers are revealed in Rev. 2 and 3 in the context of the church. They are not living by themselves. They live in the Body and for the Body. They sacrifice for the Body.

## III. The Lord's recovery is to build up Zion

The Lord's recovery in a particular way is to build up Zion. This refers to the overcomers as the reality of the Body of Christ.

#### A. Zion is the overcomers as the high peak of the church

Within Jerusalem is an elevation, a higher spot, called Zion. God loved Jerusalem in a general way, but He had a particular love for Zion.

#### B. The characteristics, blessing and life of Jerusalem come from Zion.

Zion is the beauty, the excellence of Jerusalem.

#### C. The New Jerusalem is the totality of the overcomers

The New Jerusalem will come forth in two stages. First in the millennium as a reward, and in the new heaven and new earth to all the believers. Actually every believer is an overcomer. But whether we overcome in this age is the matter. Every believer is an overcomer to participate in the eternal New Jerusalem. But to participate during the thousand years is for the "early overcomers" who take care of God's Body.

The overcomers have Zion in their heart. Not only caring for Jerusalem in a general way. They are on the highways to Zion. In their heart means something internal in their being. Take the church life internally. See what God is doing intrinsically in each one of us.

Spending time between the two altars, the bronze altar, the cross of Christ, to bear our young, and the incense altar, the resurrected and ascended Christ. This is our rest and dwelling place.

Brother Nee asked the brothers in China to hand over their names to brother Lee. Brother Lee said, what is this for? He said this is handing over your names for coordination. We hold on to our church as our kingdom, our empire. The churches, the work is necessary. But hand over. Let there be the coordination. Through that the Lord brought in a revival.

Overcomers care for the Body, for the reality of the Body.



## IV. God has blended the Body together; the word blended means adjusted, harmonized, tempered and mingled, implying the losing of distinctions.

Blending is not socialising, having a fun relaxing time. Consider these words: adjusted, harmonised, tempered, mingled. They implied the losing of distinctions. To blend requires you to hand yourself over. Don't hold on to your own work, your own interest. Be harmonised, be adjusted, lose distinction. If you use this as the standard you will wonder, how much blending you have. If we are genuinely blending we lose our distinction. We don't know who's who. We only see one Body.

**first mention and the elements**

The thought of blending is first brought in in Leviticus 2. Four elements: fine flour, oil, frankincense and the salt. The salt is the cross, the killing. The oil is the Spirit. Frankincense is Christ, the resurrection. The building up of the Body is the loaf, the bread.

**stop**

How many times do you stop? Stop to seek fellowship with others? We all have to bring this word to the Lord and consider, Lord have I stopped. I serve the church, I do this work. Have I fellowshipped enough? Or am I just doing it out of my own zeal. How do the brothers we are coordinating with feel? How can we have the reality of the Body if we don't know how to stop and seek fellowship.

**being touched**

To be blended means we are touched by others and touching others by going through the cross. We don't open up because we are afraid of being neglected, rejected or exposed. The genuine blending requires us to be willing to be touched and to touch others. We don't agree with any arguments. But we need a lot of transparency. Leading brothers can be meeting for years but there is not blending because each one hides in himself, remaining "whole" and "complete".

Hand yourself over. No-one can require this of us. We need to be touched by the Lord. I believe if we do this we will see an unprecedented revival.

## V. The desire of God's heart is that the reality in Jesus, the God-man living of Jesus as recorded in the four Gospels, would be duplicated in the many members of Christ's Body by the Spirit of reality to become the reality of the Body of Christ, the highest peak in God's economy.

Jesus' life set up a pattern. He lived a life of reality in contrast to the vanity and deceit in the world. That life was the reality in Jesus. He became a prototype, ready for reproduction. In resurrection He became a life-giving Spirit, the Spirit of reality.

Like a sister pouring dough into a cake mould. The dough begins to learn the shape of the mould. We learn to be conformed to the mould. The outcome is a cake. The Body. The learning, the conformation, is not individual, it is corporate. We were put into this Spirit for the one Body. The result of the one Spirit is the one Body. The Spirit of reality is absolutely for the Body. In John the Spirit of reality is mentioned in the context of the Father's house, the Son's vine and the Spirit's new child, which are all pictures of the Body of Christ.
