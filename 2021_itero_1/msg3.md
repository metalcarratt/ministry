# Message 3 - The factor of the church being in the Triune God, the local churches being the expressions of the Body of Christ, and the believers practicing the church life in the consciousness of the Body.

These factors are vital. You can't live without them. You could live without a finger but not without a heart. It's vital.

A compound, three-fold factor. These three things are put together. Their sequence is significant. 1) the factor of the church being in the Triune God. This has to be first. The nature, not the condition of the church. 2) the local churches being the expressions of the Body of Christ. This is a balance. (1) is abstract but (2) is practical. 3) the believers practicing the church life in the consciousness of the Body.

Two major aspects of the church - it is universal and it is local. The divine truth in the Bible always has two sides. On the contending for the faith website is an article by Covette (?) about the two-foldness of the divine truth. A lot of examples. The Triune God and the Church. The Triune God is three and one. The church as the expression of the Triune God has a universal aspect and a local aspect. It's not enough to recognise this. We don't need to "balance" both sides. You need to hold both sides. But the Bible has an emphasis. If you emphasise the wrong thing, even if you're correct, you can cause a lot of trouble.

Another principle of Biblical interpretation is the principle of first mention. What is the first mention of the church in the scriptures. Matt. 16, "I will build by church." The first aspect is not the local aspect, it is the universal aspect.

Paul's public ministry was not long. Brother Nee's was also short. Luckily Paul could write from prison. Paul spent three years in Ephesus so he was very burdened for that particular local church. Acts 20 is quite impressive. Paul not only taught the saints publicly. He went from house to house and visited all the homes of the saints in Ephesus.

...

There is no teaching on the local aspect of the church in the New Testament. But concerning the universal church, quite a lot. 

John's writings don't refer to the church as the church except in Revelation. In John he talks about the vine, etc. In the divine and mystical realm Even in Revelation after chapter 1 there is not more mention because the emphasis isn't there. 

When we handle the church we need to be very precise. We need to be careful. The saints expect that we know the truth and that what we say they can rely on. Two verses in Matthew about how the Lord Himself handled the truth. 5:18, Not one iota or one serif of the law will fall away until all is fulfilled. He doesn't say not one book or one chapter. A serif is just a little part of one letter. This is the fineness and precision of the Lord in caring for the Word of God. This is the Word of God. 23:23, you take a great deal of care for tithing but you neglect the weightier matters of the law, justice, faithfulness. You strained out a gnat and swallowed a camel. The relative weight of these two things in the Bible. Justice, mercy, faithfulness have the weight of a camel but tithing has the weight of a gnat. You would need a lot of gnats to add up to a camel. There is a different weightiness. Brother Lee likened the truth to a tree. Some items are like the branch. And other matters are like branches and leaves.



## I. The church is *in* the Triune God.

Only in 1 and 2 Thessalonians does he say the church *in* God. In other books he says the church *of* God. What did he emphasise? Brand new believers. Been in the church life one month. What does he emphasise. You are *in* the Triune God. The church in Thessalonica is *in* the Triune God. The name is the person. We put people *into* the Triune God when we baptise them. The church is also collectively *in* the Triune God. Also, he didn't say the church *in* God, he said, the church *in* God *the Father*. You can't get into the creator, the unprocessed God. But now God is our Father. He has begotten us. We can be in Him. He's not only the Father. He's in the Lord Jesus Christ. The word, 'Lord Jesus Christ' is an all-inclusive word. He's the Lord. He's Jesus, Jehovah the Saviour. Not only that, He's the Christ. He was the One anointed by God. It also means that He anoints us with God. He's the Lord. Jesus. Christ. 



#### A. The church is in the unique God and this God is our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.

Not only of God but in God. Of God means God is the nature of the church. Like the stand is of wood. The nature of the stand is wood. The nature of the stand is God. It's *of* God. It also means God possesses it. When we say the church is in God, we are talking about the position of the church. The position of the church is in contrast to the condition of the church. We live in this physical realm so we deal with all the things that are material and physical. So we are very concerned with the condition of the church. If you asked me about brother so-and-so we would talk about his condition. If you asked Paul he would say, Oh, he's in the Triune God. I talk way too much about the conditional things.

It's harder to believe the church in *my* locality is of God and in God than to believe another church is. The church in *my* locality is of God and in God, of Christ and in Christ. We should practice saying this. Paul just ignored the condition. Paul was like God. God said to Balem, "I haven't seen any iniquity in Israel." God does focus on that and doesn't emphasise that. God isn't worried about how things will turn out. He already knows. In His eternal view there's no iniquity.



#### B. The church is composed of humans who are in the Triune God.

Thessaloniki was an evil city. To be a Thessalonian is not something to be proud of. But to be in the Triune God, you should be happy with that.



#### C. The church is a group of humans born of God and brought into the organic union with Christ.

The Father indicates He is the source, the initiator, the originator. In Christ is to be united with Christ in all He is and has done. We are grafted into Him and participate in His accomplishments.



#### D. The church is in the processed Triune God, the One who has become the live-giving Spirit.



## II. A local church is an expression of the Body of Christ in a locality

"The church of God" - the universal church, "in Corinth" - the local church. Both aspects in one verse.

#### A. Many churches have one divine element, essence, expression, function and testimony.

The basis for us to practice the one accord is this oneness.

John 17:21 - that they all may be one even as I Father are in You and You are in Me that they may be in Us. We need to tell people the Triune God wanted to bring us into this relationship of coinherence that exists in the Triune God. *That* oneness is the reason we can practice oneness locality by locality.

#### B. Matt.16:18 is the first mention of the universal church; Matt. 18:17 is the first mention of the local church.

#### C. The one universal church becomes many local churches

Which comes first? The universal church or the local churches? First you have the universal church, the source. Then you have the local churches. They are like children coming from a parent.

#### D. The unique Body is expressed in many localities

The bringing forth of a local church is a birth. It's organic. You can buy a meeting hall, put a sign on it, none of that makes you the church. The church is a birth from the Body of Christ. Practically it means, the Body knows. When is a group of saints in a locality the church in that locality? Ask the father, the Body. He knows. 

#### E. Every local church is a part of the Body

#### F. The local ground of the church is the unique oneness of the Body.

Oneness is an attribute of the Body. The practice of the oneness is ...

#### G. The churches in different localities are for the universal expression of Christ

The tests of whether a local church is a genuine church or not. Not having a different name or teaching. Last one is, a genuine local church has fellowship with all the local churches on the whole earth. 

#### H. In our consideration the Body should be first and the local churches should be second

This is the matter of emphasis. We care about both. If I have two things, one is first and the other is second. The Body should always be first. Any consideration we have about the church in our locality should be with the Body in mind.

All the local churches are the one unique universal church. They all have the same One Spirit. In this light we need to reconsider our present understanding of the church. Our present understanding of the church may be unbalanced. We also need to know the Body in practice. Locality as the church ground separates the church in existence but does not divide the church in essence. We are still one Body on the globe Our thought needs to be revolutionised. We should consider our local church a part of the Body of Christ.

The overcomers will live in the reality of the Body of Christ in *this* age, the age of procedure. I love the "procedure"; I gave my whole life to it, but I want to reach the goal, which is to live in the reality of the Body of Christ.



## II. In practicing the church life we need to have the consciousness of the Body.

#### A. We must have a feeling for the Body, taking the feeling of the Head as our own feeling

Our enjoyment of Christ causes us to have the consciousness of the Body of Christ. It's through our enjoyment and experience of Christ that His feeling becomes our feeling.

#### B. *Whatever* we do involves the Body.

We don't have this consciousness. This is my decision, my activity. It can't be because you're a member of the Body. We must have a proper consideration of the Body. How the Body would feel about what we are doing. How we behave ourselves depends on our seeing the Body. Br. Nee strongly emphasised the matter of seeing. He asked those under his perfecting to speak about their seeing of the Body in a training. Then he would tell them, you haven't seen the body. Don't think that just by time you will have seen the Body. I know people who have been in the recovery for many decades who don't see the Body. We have to really pray for this. If we are only in one accord in our local church this one accord is a sect.

#### C. Among the churches there is no organisation but there is fellowship.

Don't cut yourself off from the fellowship. The fellowship is vital. You'll die without it. We don't have organisation. We have broad, even universal, fellowship. Most spiritual sicknesses are because of lack of circulation.



A short word of application.

How can we have an increased consciousness of the Body of Christ. A few points:

1. We must see the Body. We shouldn't just assume. We need to pray. That's Paul's prayer in Ephesians 1; that we would see the Body.
2. We must see and enjoy Christ in the way of Christ making His home in our heart. Ephesians 3.
3. We need to live corporately under the Head, taking the Head as the life, principle object, and center. Ephesians 4.
4. Grow up into the Head. Also Eph. 4. Consciousness comes from life.
5. We need to coordinate with all the members. It will frustrate us but will help us. They all have different gifts and functions.
6. We need to recognise the authority in the Body. Authority in the Body is organic. It's not organisational or hierarchical but it does exist.
7. We need to blend. Blending will bring in the reality of the Body of Christ.
