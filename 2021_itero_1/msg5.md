# Message 5 - The factor of the genuine one accord

Two points on brother Lee's heart - the propagation of the truths, that such truths were not intended not only for the people in the Lord's recovery but all God's believers. One of out main commissions is to spread, propagate these truths, believing many are the lovers and seekers of the Lord. The second burden was the strengthening of the church life in so many places. We cannot say with a good conscience that the church life everywhere is as strong, healthy and impactful as it should be. So these messages are very much with this in view. The recovery of the church life must be a powerful, prevailing one. If we cooperate with these factors in a living way, then the church life in the churches will be strong, healthy. This will draw the people to the Lord and to the Lord's purpose.

The genuine one accord. The one accord is the master key to all the divine blessings from the Triune God. If we lose our one accord, even just a hint of divisiveness or separation or sectarian, we will miss that blessing. That commanded blessing of life is upon the brothers who are dwelling together in oneness. Not only in oneness but actually in the practice of that oneness, which is the one accord.



## I. The genuine one accord is *the practice* (the carrying out, the implementation) of the oneness of the Body, which is the oneness of the Spirit.

Eph. 4, being diligent to keep the oneness of the Spirit in the uniting bond of peace. One Body and one Spirit, even as also you were called in one hope of your calling. One Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God and Father of all who is over all and in all.

Seven crucial ones. This is the base of this great attribute of the oneness of the church. The first attribute of the church is her oneness. If you don't have the oneness you don't have the church. However this is just the oneness. But we need to practice ths oneness. When we practice, work out, live, this oneness, that oneness will become, in our experience, our one accord. This keeping of the oneness is really the practice of the one accord. The oneness was given to God's people but was not kept, it was broken by all kinds of things such as the world, divisions, teachings. It broke the Body into millions of pieces, cutting it up. The Body becomes a cut up corpse. Today, one of the main things we must take care of is to maintain that oneness. Paul said in verse 1, I beseech you to walk worthily of the calling with which you were called. What is the worthy walk that every Christian should make? It is simply the oneness that keep. When we keep the oneness, that is the first worthy walk.

Footnote of verse 3. To walk worthily of God's calling we first need to care for the oneness. We are here to practice the Body life, and the first order is to care for the oneness of the Body which actually is the oneness of the Spirit. Oneness differs from unity. Unity is where many people are united together. Oneness is the one entity of the Spirit within the believers who makes them all One. This oneness is a Person dwelling in us. We are not talking about unification, to come together and shake hands. The oneness we are talking about is the oneness of the Triune God. This Triune God has been dispensed into us, and to possess this Triune God is now to possess this oneness. What a shame to have the Lord's Body cut up as it is.

To keep the one accord we have to practice the one accord. 

We all have a "billion dollars in the bank." But what use is it if we never write a cheque? Never use what we have? We have this oneness in us, but we need to apply Him in our church life. Between husbands and wives, between churches, among elders, among serving ones. Safe guard this oneness that the Lord will have an anti-testimony.

We need to be "diligent", "exercised". The moment we are not watchful some divisive factors will come in among us. We need to fight for this, be diligent over it.



#### A. Our practice of the oneness is based on the attribute of the oneness of the church

The seven ones are the form, the attribute of the church. We are one because we are one in these seven things and we possess these seven ones.

#### B. The practice of the oneness is the *application* of the oneness

Don't just talk about it. Practice.

In the first church, in Jerusalem, in Acts 1:14, they all continued steadfastly with one accord in prayer. It has to start with prayer. Genuine prayer brings us, ushers us, into the mingled spirit, where oneness is. Oneness is not in our mind or emotion. Oneness is not in our soul. We will see our soul must be one, but in itself, we are just all divergent, diversely minded. Our thinking is all different. We need to come back to the Spirit first. Before we do anything, coordinate, fellowship; first of all we should pray, to turn from our mind and everything else that divides us and turn to our mingled Spirit.

After Pentecost the first description, "continued steadfastly with one accord." The one accord before Pentecost was because they have the indwelling Spirit of life. Not, they also have the outpoured Spirit. It is still the same one Spirit. With the one Spirit within and without they continued steadfastly with one accord. What enabled them to go on harmoniously, joyfully. Any time there is some problem between two brothers or two sisters, you just feel the smile of the Lord is gone. The dove of the spirit has flown away. The anointing on the head of Aaron is not coming down. The dew of Hermon is not descending. When there is disagreement. Just a little bit causes us to lose the joy and the power in the church life.

#### C. When the oneness is practiced it becomes the one accord.

Acts 15, It seemed to good to us, having become of one accord. Even in the choosing of men, the sending out of believers, the one accord was kept, practised. Brothers, never break the one accord. Let us keep the one accord, diligently.

It was the prayer *in* one accord that brought forth the out-pouring of the Spirit.

#### D. The one accord is the heart, the kernel and the nucleus of the oneness

The sickness among us is we don't have the one accord among us. We try to maintain the "oneness" with a sick heart. We "shake the hands for the camera", but really no one accord inside. I'm critical of you, you dislike me. The moment the camera crew is out we split to different corners. That is just a performance.

## II. The one accord refers to the harmony in our inner being, in our mind and will.

This is not just a kind of harmony in our spirit, but the difference is our diverse opinion in our mind. Our different wills, judgements, decisions, preferences. All diverse and different. This is where the problem comes in, many times in our church life. 

**homothumadon** - a harmony of inward feeling in our entire being. The mind is the most challenging organ to be of one mind. The second is the will, the oneness of purpose. The oneness of soul and in our heart. We are harmonised in our inward feeling about something. This is not just singing a song about oneness that we are one. This is a true oneness of our entire being with one another.

Is it possible? It is, but it requires our exercise, our cooperation. It requires us to have the Spirit, to be joined to the Spirit. To have the same one goal of building up the Body of Christ.

**sumphoneo** (symphony) - the harmonious sound of musical instruments or voices. In Matt. 18:19, if two of you are in one accord. The oneness starts with two. It's easy to say a thousand of us are in one accord. What about two of you? The requirement is that two are in real harmony. Like an orchestra you may have the trumpet I may have the Obba, but we are playing the same key, the same manuscript, the same conductor. The right tempo, the right feeling. All the musicians would be identifying with this. For us, this must be the Lord's feeling that must have worked its way into our feelings.

It is exhausting to hear the orchestra before the performance when they are practising. Each musician has a "gift", but without working together, playing their own "solos", there is just a sound that is disturbing.

Two brothers praying would be like music in His ears. You have been in prayer meetings, many saints are praying, but all you hear is one prayer. I forgot who prayed. There was just one prayer, one intercession that ascended to God. Be assured that will be answered.

## III. The holding factor of the one accord is the apostle's teaching

One of the guard rails to keep us in the one accord is the teaching. If we all have different teachings there is no way to have one accord. Paul charged Timothy to charge others not to have different teachings. Not necessarily wrong but different. When all the churches received this one teaching we can have the one accord.

Some ask how we can be so restrictive? All the churches follow the same ministry, eat the same food, are being taught the same. Praise the Lord! If we all have different kinds of teachings, already we are divided. We need to remain in the teaching of the apostles.

If the believers in Acts did not stay with the apostle's teaching, ... At the end of Matthew the Lord commissioned the apostles to teach "all that I commanded you." The apostle's teaching is the Lord's teaching.

Paul taught the same thing to all saints in all places. It is rare to see this in church history.

Let us put aside all the different "schools of teaching."

## IV. When we practice the one accord we must learn to be in one spirit with one soul

Start with the Spirit and let the Spirit spread to other parts of our being.

**our opinion**

We all need to be "attuned" to the same key. The first problem in Corinth was their diverse mindedness, the difference in opinion. I like Paul. I think Cephas is better. Even that kind of opinion showed they did not have the same mind.

The problem in the church life that keeps us from realising the one accord is our opinion. The Lord told Peter, get behind Me Satan. He had an opinion. But it was Satanic. We need to subdue, cancel, our opinion. Let our opinions die, go.

The more we protect, relish our opinion. The more we "oppine", spread our opinion. We are not only in darnkess, we lead the saints into darkness and hurt the one accord.

Lord, give us your mind, your feeling.

**our speaking **

Even our outward speaking is the same. Some people like to be original, as if that is a glory. No, out glory is to speak with one mouth, with one spirit. The mind of Christ, the mouth of the Head.

## V. The one accord is the master key to every blessing in the New Testament

Everything depends on God's blessing. Lord, everything depends on your blessing. In my life, my family, my marriage, my church. Without your blessing everything is doomed.

Practice the oneness. The way to practice the oneness is the one accord.
