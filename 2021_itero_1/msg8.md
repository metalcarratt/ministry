# Message 8 - The factor of living an overcoming life in the recovered church to consummate the divine economy and become the New Jerusalem

A factor is an element contributing to a particular result. A result is being sought, and factors are elements that contribute to that result. A stronger definition is, something that actively contributes to the production of a result.

In God's eternal economy there is an ultimate goal, the building up of the Body of Christ. That must be the result. And in this age, the age of the church, there needs to be the understanding and experience and application of various vital factors for the recovery of the church life. In the early days we just had the thought, "we have arrived," "this is it." All we have to do is stand here, singing, call, have meetings, and that's it. But that's not it. Because the local churches are the procedure to have the reality of the Body of Christ. It is not only possible, but actual, that local churches have existed and do exist that are not contributing to this result.

The recovered church is not the factor. Even in Philadelphia the Lord calls for overcomers and then it is the overcomers in the recovered church who will consummate the divine economy and become the New Jerusalem.

A brief look at the Lord's own speaking about this. Matt. 17:18, "I will build my church." This is His goal. He's praying for this right now. As necessary he is carrying out His administration, through the Body He is carrying out warfare, but the focus is on the church life. Matt. 18:17, "tell it to the church," "listen to the church." Rev. 1, "send it to the seven churches." Then the Lord named seven cities. So clear, isn't it? In His eyes, church, city. In ch 2:1,8,12,18, in ch 3:1,7,14 he says, "the church". "the church in ..." At the end of the entire Bible in Rev 22:16, "I, Jesus, have sent my Angel to testify these things, for the churches." The Lord did not simply say, "I will build my church" and then give many instructions and ascend. He made it clear that the way ordained by God is through "the church", through the local churches. They are the God-established procedure.

The Lord *must* recover genuine local churches, or He has no way to build up His church. Many theologians, pastors, Bible teachers, have this thought, "That's ancient history. That's what happened. All this development, we have to live with all these different name. But don't worry. In heaven we'll drop all the names, we'll be one." The basic reason is for that teaching is the lack of willingness to pay the price to return to the recovered church of God. That would entail all these ministers and pastors giving up their clergy status and being simply brothers.

A local church, illustrated by the church in Ephesus, that had left the first love, the Lord said, "unless you repent, I will remove the lampstand from your locality." He didn't say, "I will abolish the church." No, it will still exist. But in what way? Empty. An empty local church. It's possible for a church to be empty. I will read to you a paragraph from the conclusion of the NT, 

"We need to be deeply impressed with the fact that the reality of the kingdom is the content of the church life. This means without the reality of the kingdom the church is empty. The reality of the kingdom is actually Christ Himself as our life. Christ as life is the essence, the substance, for us to live a proper church life. The real church life is a glorious expression of Christ. When Christ is expressed, the entire Triune God is expressed. This expression depends on whether the believers live a life that is in the reality of the kingdom described in Matthew. This reality is the genuine content of the church life."

There are a few thousand churches on the earth. Only the Lord knows for sure. But many are empty. Beginning with the leading brothers. Where is the reality? Where's the constitution? Where is the central work of God being carried out? On the other hand, in other churches the elders take the lead to experience the Lord, enjoy the Lord, to grow in life, to shepherd according to God. All of us need more training, more experience, more development.

LS of Galations msg 3, "I am concerned that many of us are trying to practice the church life apart from Christ. If this is the case, our church life will be nothing more than a religion with its own kind of tradition. How desperately we need a revelation of this living person. It is crucial that He is revealed in us."

Do we entertain the thought that this is not possible with us? "That was with the Brethren, they didn't know about this and that, we've been taught so many things. We can't be that." We should have no trust in the flesh, in our constitution, in what we know.

I don't want to cultivate any kind of tradition or religion. I'm not looking backward. We're pressing on, pressing on toward the goal.

"To the messenger of the church in Philadelphia write, ..., I know your works, behold I have put before you an open door which no one can shut because you have a little power and have kept my word and not denied my name, ..., because you have kept the word of my endurance I also will keep you out of the hour of trial ... I come quickly, hold fast what you have that no-one take away your crown. *He who overcomers, him I will make a pillar in the temple of My God and he shall by no means go out anymore and I will write upon him the name of My God and the name of the city of My God, New Jerusalem, which descends out of heaven, and My new name* ..."

## I. The overcomers are produced by the overcoming Christ as the sevenfold intensified Spirit, and they are burdened for the building up of the Body of Christ as the preparation of the Bride of Christ

His way is to reproduce Himself as *the* overcomer in so many seekers who seek for this, pray for this. He will reproduce Himself.

#### A. The overcomers are for the building up of the Body of Christ

If there are no overcomers in the recovered church then the Body of Christ cannot be built up. Unless the Body of Christ is built up the Bride cannot be made ready. Maybe we will have to wait another generation or two. We say no to that. Lord, work it out now.

The overcomers, when they come with the Lord to the earth, will be the first stage of the New Jerusalem. The Lord needs overcomers if the Body is to be built up, in order for the Bride to be built up. When the Lord determines the building is sufficient then it's "rapture time."

#### B. The Lord's promises in Rev 2-3 refer both to the present enjoyment of the overcomers and the reward given to them in the coming kingdom

Example, eating the tree of life is a promise, a reward. But that must also be the present experience of that overcoming saint. The reward will be a manifestation of what we become inwardly, organically.

Verse 12 again, "He who overcomers, I will make a pillar in the temple of My God." When? In the church life now. "And I will write upon him the name of My God and the name of the city of My God, Jerusalem ... and My new name." Will it happen suddenly? No. The actual being made a pillar and having God, Christ and the New Jerusalem written on us, all happens now. 

Break through any hinderance in our being. In each one of us personally.

## II. As a sign, the church in Philadelphia prefigures the recovered church

She keeps the Lord word. Yes, this is a characteristic of the churches in the Lord's recovery.

He exercises the key to open all the Lords to His recovered church.
