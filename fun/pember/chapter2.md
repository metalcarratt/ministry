# Chapter 2 - The Creation

## The popular error about Creation coming from Pagan doctrine

At the beginning of our study we encounter a popular error regarding the creation
of the world - an error with a long history and which seems to have come from
a compromise between the Word of Pagan beliefs.

The poet Hesiod tells us the first thing to exist was Chaos,

| "the yawning and void receptacle for created matter." 

But it soon lost its meanng and was used for the
shapeless matter out of which the heavens and earth were supposedly formed.
Ovid describes it:

| "There was but one appearance of nature throughout the whole world: this they called Chaos, an unformed and confused bulk."

And in his "Fasti" he make Janus, whom he identifies with Chaos, say:

| "The ancients used to call me Chaos: for a primeval being am I. See of how remote an age I shall recount the events! This air, full of light, and the three remaining elements, fire, water, and earth, were a confused heap. As soon as this mass was separated through the discord of its component parts, and had dissolvved and passed away into new positions, the flame ascended upwards; a nearer place - that is, nearer to earth - received the air; the earth and the sea settled down to the bottom. Then I, who had been but a mass and shapeless bulk, passed into a form and limbs worthy of a god."
