# Chapter 2 - The Creation

## The popular error about Creation coming from Pagan doctrine

At the beginning of our study we encounter a popular error regarding the creation
of the world - an error with a long history and which seems to have come from
a compromise between the Word of Pagan beliefs.

The poet Hesiod tells us the first thing to exist was Chaos,
> "the yawning and void receptacle for created matter." 

But it soon lost its meanng and was used for the
shapeless matter out of which the heavens and earth were supposedly formed.
Ovid describes it:

> "There was but one appearance of nature throughout the whole world: this they called Chaos, an unformed and confused bulk."

And in his "Fasti" he make Janus, whom he identifies with Chaos, say:

> "The ancients used to call me Chaos: for a primeval being am I. See of how remote an age I shall recount the events! This air, full of light, and the three remaining elements, fire, water, and earth, were a confused heap. As soon as this mass was separated through the discord of its component parts, and had dissolvved and passed away into new positions, the flame ascended upwards; a nearer place - that is, nearer to earth - received the air; the earth and the sea settled down to the bottom. Then I, who had been but a mass and shapeless bulk, passed into a form and limbs worthy of a god."

Thus according to Greek and Roman cosmologies the universe sprang from Chaos. Uranus was the first supreme god but was driven from power by his son Cronos (Saturn), who was later replaced by his own son Zeus (Jupiter). Chaos was the first thing in existence and the gods came after.

## Influencing the Christian world

This belief was widespread at the time of the Lord and also influenced Christians. The Gnostics believed matter was eternal and evil, but unlike the pagans also believed in a Supreme Being who existed from eternity. The genuine Christians were not caught by this error but were still influenced by it in their interpretation of chapter 1 of Genesis. For they made the first verse signify the creation of a confused mass of elements out of which the heavens and earth were formed in six days. Their opinion is with us till today. But such a thought does not match the Bible, as we shall soon see. How great a conflict it has created with the world! How the geological error in this view opens the door for attack against the Bible! How perplexing to understand that time before the sin of Adam! How many young minds have turned away because they could not defend what they were taught was the word of God! And how much precious time has been wasted which could have been better spent?

## Examination of the book of Genesis

Let's turn now to Genesis and try to understand the plain meaning.

> In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.

'Beginning' refers to the first existence of heaven and earth. Here it is quite clear that God was before all things seen and by His will they came into being. This short sentence disproves the pagan thought that God is one with nature. Nature is His creation, the work of His hands: her years can be numbered and when she was created, but God is everlasting.

### The earth is said to have been "created" while in the six days they were "made"

In this decription the heavens and earth were not moulded out of existing material but created. The Hebrew word 'bara' certainly means to call into being without the aid of existing material. The Hebrew writers treated its meaning as such and Rabbi Nackman says there is no other word to describe the idea of production out of nothing. The popular "development" theories of today indicate the natural bend of human minds. The philosophic poet Lucretius said, "Nothing is even gotten out of nothing by Divine power."

Perhaps the word used here to express 'creation' may have previously meant to form out of existing material, but its use in the Bible is clear. We are told God *created* the heaven and the earth, but not so with the six days following. The work of those days, as we shall see, was quite different; they were a time of restoration and the word 'asah' is generally used.
