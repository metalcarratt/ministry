# Chapter 2 - The Creation

## The popular error about Creation coming from Pagan doctrine

At the beginning of our study we encounter a popular error regarding the creation
of the world - an error with a long history and which seems to have come from
a compromise between the Word of Pagan beliefs.

The poet Hesiod tells us the first thing to exist was Chaos,
> "the yawning and void receptacle for created matter." 

But it soon lost its meanng and was used for the
shapeless matter out of which the heavens and earth were supposedly formed.
Ovid describes it:

> "There was but one appearance of nature throughout the whole world: this they called Chaos, an unformed and confused bulk."

And in his "Fasti" he make Janus, whom he identifies with Chaos, say:

> "The ancients used to call me Chaos: for a primeval being am I. See of how remote an age I shall recount the events! This air, full of light, and the three remaining elements, fire, water, and earth, were a confused heap. As soon as this mass was separated through the discord of its component parts, and had dissolvved and passed away into new positions, the flame ascended upwards; a nearer place - that is, nearer to earth - received the air; the earth and the sea settled down to the bottom. Then I, who had been but a mass and shapeless bulk, passed into a form and limbs worthy of a god."

Thus according to Greek and Roman cosmologies the universe sprang from Chaos. Uranus was the first supreme god but was driven from power by his son Cronos (Saturn), who was later replaced by his own son Zeus (Jupiter). Chaos was the first thing in existence and the gods came after.

## Influencing the Christian world

This belief was widespread at the time of the Lord and also influenced Christians. The Gnostics believed matter was eternal and evil, but unlike the pagans also believed in a Supreme Being who existed from eternity. The genuine Christians were not caught by this error but were still influenced by it in their interpretation of chapter 1 of Genesis. For they made the first verse signify the creation of a confused mass of elements out of which the heavens and earth were formed in six days. Their opinion is with us till today. But such a thought does not match the Bible, as we shall soon see. How great a conflict it has created with the world! How the geological error in this view opens the door for attack against the Bible! How perplexing to understand that time before the sin of Adam! How many young minds have turned away because they could not defend what they were taught was the word of God! And how much precious time has been wasted which could have been better spent?
