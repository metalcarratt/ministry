# Introduction - Biblical interpretation. Importance of Prophetic Scripture

## Objection to Christianity because of the diversity of Biblical interpretation
Before we talk about revelation it would be good to talk about Bible interpretation. These days people argue against Christianity because of the many opinions in it.
People point at the many divisions in Christianity and the numerous disagreements between Christians, even over vital truths. They say the Bible is open to
many interpretations and is the basis of many differening and conflicting systems of belief.

Not only those in Christian countries feel this way, it is spreading among heathen countries, has given them a weapon to use against those who worship the
Triune God and is now a barrier to the gospel.

## Diversity caused by man, not the Word
We cannot deny there are many divisions among so-called Christians. We must go further and admit that there are differences of opinion and opposing doctrines
even among those who call on the name of the Lord sincerely and have faith in His sacrifice for sin. All claim their doctrines are derived from the Word
of God.

What then shall we say in defence? Is the Bible really so inconsistent and vague that conflicting opinions and doctrines can be honestly understood from it?
If so this would indeed be a strong argument against the Bible being the Word of God. But we are not forced to think this way. As soon as we consider the
probelm an obvious solution can be found. The fault lies not with the Bible but with those who interpret it; it is because of the fallen and corrupt nature
of man which affects him so much that he cannot see the truth when placed before his eyes.

## Proof from early history of the church
Do we doubt this? Let's first look at when the gospel was first received in the New Testament. Do we not find error and truth intermixed from the beginning?
Was not the Apostle Paul anxious that after planting a church weeds might soon threaten to choke it? As examples we have Corinth, Galatia and Colossae; the strange
doctrines at Ephesus and Crete mentioned in Timothy and Titus; the warnings against heresy in the epistles of Peter, John and Jude. If we look at the other
(non-Biblical) writings of the early church we have the same sad impression - the message of God was not received as it should have been.

## Three classes of corrupters
Men didn't come with clean, unmarked hearts when they were impressed with God's will and purpose; they came filled with myths, philosophies and biases which they could
not completely get rid off. At least in part, perhaps unknowingly, mixing these with the truth of God.  As time went by it became more obvious that this mixture was
incompatible but men clung to it because it softened the revelation of God, forcing it to sympathise with the fallen human nature.

They soon found they were forced to blunt the sword of the Spirit which would otherwise have severed the impurity from the genuine truth. This was done. Those parts of the
Word which were most in conflict with the hopes and feelings of men were allegorised or spiritualised, their literal meaning removed and thus deprived of the power God had
placed on them. As such they could no longer prevent the entrance of false doctrine. And so far we are talking only about the damage done by those who were probably
sincere Christians who corrupted the Word of God through short-sightedness, lack of wisdom and the ability to clear the mind of the ideas of common man.

### The second class of corrupters - those who joined the church out of self interest
There was another class of corrupters described by Paul as, "many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers... who subvert whole houses teaching things which they ought
not, for filthy lucre's sake." These were men who, when they saw Christianity spreading rapidly and how it had a hold on the minds of those who heard it, desired to become
leaders of such promising movement for their own ambition. They had no concern about introducing doctrines which suited themselves and used the Bible as a book by which
they could justify their own opinions.

### The third class of corrupters - those who joined for the purpose of corrupting Christianity
Lastly a third class of men devoted to higher forms of pagan worship, the initiates of mysteries, whose secret societies had spread over the whole civilised earth. They crept in like wolves in sheeps clothing, with deliberate intent to destroy the flock of God. From the beginning they marked the Christians as their enemies. They perceived that the persecution of the Roman emperors, from Nero to Galerius, failed to suppress the church and realised it could not be exterminated through open warfare and must instead be corrupted from within. This plan was more successful than persecution. Where the sword failed, flattery was victorious. The church was astonished to see her oppressor's frown turning into a smile with offers of peace and union. Becoming elated with the sudden change the church was open to compromise. Thus the world became nominally Christian, and many idolators passed into the visible church, bringing with them their old gods and goddesses under new names, as well as their sacrifices and rites. The philosophers also contributed their share of confusion and speedily made every vital doctrine of Christianity obscure. By skillfully blending their own systems with the truths of the Bible they bewildered the minds of the multitude so that few remained who could distinguish the true revelation of God from the craftily interwoven teachings of men.

## The explanation for the diversity of Biblical interpretation
The corruption of the Word of God was so complete. The church has never fully freed herself from it, though she made much effort during the Reformation. From the time the enemy first sowed the tares, they have been mingled with the wheat and will remain until the harvest. Thus inconsistent interpretations were handed down from generation to generation and received as if they were scripture themselves. Any portion of the Bible which was in disagreement with them has been allegorised, spiritualised or explained away. From time to time groups formed that were more or less pure but in all of them the enemy managed to sow some error, and the men who see their church as the only perfect one fight fiercly for their beliefs, even to the point of twisting the Word of God to prove their point.

Considering all these things we should not accuse the Bible of being vague or inconsistent. If we are honest we will feel how difficult it is to approach the Bible without bias, bringing with us many ideas we already assume to be correct, never consider to test against the Word and only seek to find confirmation. Yet if we were to thoroughly investigate we may find some of these ideas are not in the Bible at all while others are contradicted by it. For many popular doctrines can be traced back through church history till we trace them back to a source in the enemy himself.

## We must study with out prejudice and with prayer for the guidance of the Spirit
Proof of the above will come as we study this subject. But every Christian needs to test this matter for himself, if he really desires the Kingdom of God over his own preferences. God will grant the wisdom if we just ask for it. But let us believe that the Bible is the infallible word of the great Creator and that all men are prone to make errors. Then we will see that to understand the truth of any doctrine we must get rid of our existing concepts and have no feeling for or against it. Then, with earnest prayer for the Spirit's help, let us examine every portion of the Word we come across, noting the simple and obvious teaching and how various other portions of the Word fit together with it. But there is another thing we must be careful of: the degree of importance each passage of the Word is given. For even true doctrines can cause issues if they are emphasised above other doctrines that the Bible has placed a higher importance on.

## This approach would put an end to diversity if followed
If Christians did this there would soon be an end to diverse opinions in the real church. True followers of Christ would present a single coherent interpretation to the world. The greatest obstacle to the gospel would be removed. And the result of our preaching would be very different. For the sword of the Spirit pierces through the body and soul to shine on the God-conscious spirit within.

## Revised interest in the prophetic scriptures
We now propose to study an important subject - the history, past, present and future, of the ages of the world. To learn about how our God deals with the earth and its inhabitants and what His purpose is.

May the Holy Spirit guide us with a wisdom that is not our own. May He keep us from handling the Word deceitfully. May He enable us to consider it without bais and to discern the meaning He intended to convey.

For the most part we will focus on prophecy, a subject which after 1500 years, has been neglected. As another long age draws to a close the time is right and the Lord will not hide from us what He intends to do.

## Believers should not object to study prophecy
Many Christians object to studying prophecy.  But a little consideration should convince us of this error. More than a fourth of the Bible is prophetic - if God has so much to say, would we dare refuse to listen? If He has called our attention to this matter should we say, It doesn't profit us? Surely if we don't heed His voice we are setting our will in opposition to Him and we should question whther we are really in faith. "IF any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of His." If the Spirit loves to dwell on God's future purposes, will not the mind of everyone who has the Spirit have a similar desire? Should we not have the same feeling? If the Spirit of God is really influencing us, shouldn't there be a testimony in our spirit?

## Three great blessings for studying prophecy
In the last book of the Bible we find a special blessing to him who reas it and hears the words of the prophecy. This promise is not merely for those who read it and fully  understand and are able to explain it to others, but for all those who read with full attention, whether they can penetrate the depth of the meaning or not. It is not difficult to see the way the blessing comes. We will consider three of them.

First, the study of prophecy is commanded and we know the grace of God is given to those who obey God. If we search out even His smallest commands and do them and show that we would not allow any of His words to fall to the ground we testify to others that we do in deed, not only in word, that we recognise Him as our God and King.

He will also certain acknowledge us as His subjects, we who claim His aid and protection. He will give us grace to help with every need. His covering sheild will cover us when the darts of the enemy are thrown at us. His strength will uphold us when our heart and flesh fail His hand will guide us when we are surrounded by darkness. He will hold our hand as he brings us through the night to gaze on the golden gates of the Paradise of GOd.

### Second - prophecy teaches us of the end of all things and helps us set our hopes on the world to come
Second, if a man reads a prophecy and believes it, even if he doesn't understand it, he can't help but be convicted of how transitory the present things are. We easily hold the thought that things will always stay the same, nothing will change, except in ordinary ways, by things we can easily see.

Prophecy dispels this false security, and so men either turn away from it or try to explain it away as something not to be worried about. They find it difficult to believe in sudden change. They prefer to speak of future times when the gospel is strong and many men believe in God. They like to push the influence of their own sect but confuse political power with the power of the SPirit. And then they forget who is the current Prince of this World (Satan).

Some are inter-denominational, despising the narrowmindedness of the divisions, yet ignoring the fact they hold many opinions of their own which they hold to tightly. And so they preach a gospel of peace and good will from a God who doesn't care about sin and predit a golden age of freedom, equality and friendship. Yet if you test them whether they love their neighbours as themselves they would go away not only in sorrow but in wrath.

Men will readily adopt such ideas for they are consistent with continuing the present order of things. They imagine all will come to perfection without any shock or supernatural intervention.

But if someone looks at the future presented by God they will have very different thoughts. They will see the conflict between good and evil intensify until what is good seems almost annihilated. He would see the cities of the nations in ruins, the sun withdrawing its light, the moon becoming as blood, what is solid becomes distorted like in a dream until with a flash the Son of Man is seen coming in the clouds of heaven. He would see red lightning flash on the earth, many slain by the Lord. Then when the thunders cease and the lightning stops, the earth would come forth from the smoke and ruin as a purified garden of Eden. The city of Jerusalem would appear at the foot of Mount Zion and upon it the temple described by Ezekiel, to which all men would come to worship the Lord.

For it is by the strong arm of the Almighty, not preaching, that the world will come to acknowledge her Creator and at last find rest. The preaching of the gospel now is to call out those chosen by God as a witness to mankind. But as Isaiah says, it is only when the judgements of the Lord are on the earth that its inhabitants will learn righteousness.

The devout ready of prophecy will at least by able to see this and so, when the close of this age comes as a snare upon those who dwell on the earth, he will be prepared and undismayed.
