# Introduction - Biblical interpretation. Importance of Prophetic Scripture

## Objection to Christianity because of the diversity of Biblical interpretation
Before we talk about revelation it would be good to talk about Bible interpretation. These days people argue against Christianity because of the many opinions in it.
People point at the many divisions in Christianity and the numerous disagreements between Christians, even over vital truths. They say the Bible is open to
many interpretations and is the basis of many differening and conflicting systems of belief.

Not only those in Christian countries feel this way, it is spreading among heathen countries, has given them a weapon to use against those who worship the
Triune God and is now a barrier to the gospel.

## Diversity caused by man, not the Word
We cannot deny there are many divisions among so-called Christians. We must go further and admit that there are differences of opinion and opposing doctrines
even among those who call on the name of the Lord sincerely and have faith in His sacrifice for sin. All claim their doctrines are derived from the Word
of God.

What then shall we say in defence? Is the Bible really so inconsistent and vague that conflicting opinions and doctrines can be honestly understood from it?
If so this would indeed be a strong argument against the Bible being the Word of God. But we are not forced to think this way. As soon as we consider the
probelm an obvious solution can be found. The fault lies not with the Bible but with those who interpret it; it is because of the fallen and corrupt nature
of man which affects him so much that he cannot see the truth when placed before his eyes.

## Proof from early history of the church
Do we doubt this? Let's first look at when the gospel was first received in the New Testament. Do we not find error and truth intermixed from the beginning?
Was not the Apostle Paul anxious that after planting a church weeds might soon threaten to choke it? As examples we have Corinth, Galatia and Colossae; the strange
doctrines at Ephesus and Crete mentioned in Timothy and Titus; the warnings against heresy in the epistles of Peter, John and Jude. If we look at the other
(non-Biblical) writings of the early church we have the same sad impression - the message of God was not received as it should have been.

## Three classes of corrupters
Men didn't come with clean, unmarked hearts when they were impressed with God's will and purpose; they came filled with myths, philosophies and biases which they could
not completely get rid off. At least in part, perhaps unknowingly, mixing these with the truth of God.  As time went by it became more obvious that this mixture was
incompatible but men clung to it because it softened the revelation of God, forcing it to sympathise with the fallen human nature.

They soon found they were forced to blunt the sword of the Spirit which would otherwise have severed the impurity from the genuine truth. This was done. Those parts of the
Word which were most in conflict with the hopes and feelings of men were allegorised or spiritualised, their literal meaning removed and thus deprived of the power God had
placed on them. As such they could no longer prevent the entrance of false doctrine. And so far we are talking only about the damage fone by those who were probably
sincere Christians who corrupted the Word of God through short-sightedness, lack of wisdom and the ability to clear the mind of the ideas of common man.

### The second class of corrupters - those who joined the church out of self interest
There was another class of corrupters described by Paul as, "many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers... who subvert whole houses teaching things which they ought
not, for filthy lucre's sake." These were men who, when they saw Christianity spreading rapidly and how it had a hold on the minds of those who heard it, desired to become
leaders of such promising movement for their own ambition. They had no concern about introducing doctrines which suited themselves and used the Bible as a book by which
they could justify their own opinions.

### The third class of corrupters - those who joined for the purpose of corrupting Christianity
Lastly a third class of men devoted to higher forms of pagan worship, the initiates of mysteries, whose secret societies had spread over the whole civilised earth. They crept in like wolves in sheeps clothing, with deliberate intent to destroy the flock of God. From the beginning they marked the Christians as their enemies. They perceived that the persecution of the Roman emperors, from Nero to Galerius, failed to suppress the church and realised it could not be exterminated through open warfare and must instead be corrupted from within. This plan was more successful than persecution. Where the sword failed, flattery was victorious. The church was astonished to see her oppressor's frown turning into a smile with offers of peace and union. Becoming elated with the sudden change the church was open to compromise. Thus the world became nominally Christian, and many idolators passed into the visible church, bringing with them their old gods and goddesses under new names, as well as their sacrifices and rites. The philosophers also contributed their share of confusion and speedily made every vital doctrine of Christianity obscure. By skillfully blending their own systems with the truths of the Bible they bewildered the minds of the multitude so that few remained who could distinguish the true revelation of God from the craftily interwoven teachings of men.

## The explanation for the diversity of Biblical interpretation
The corruption of the Word of God was so complete. The church has never fully freed herself from it, though she made much effort during the Reformation. From the time the enemy first sowed the tares, they have been mingled with the wheat and will remain until the harvest. Thus inconsistent interpretations were handed down from generation to generation and received as if they were scripture themselves. Any portion of the Bible which was in disagreement with them has been allegorised, spiritualised or explained away. From time to time groups formed that were more or less pure but in all of them the enemy managed to sow some error, and the men who see their church as the only perfect one fight with fiercly for their beliefs, even to the point of twisted the Word of God to prove their point.

Considering all these things we should not accuse the Bible of being vague or inconsistent. If we are honest we will feel how difficult it is to approach the Bible without bias, bringing with us many ideas we already assume to be correct, never consider to test against the Word and only seek to find confirmation. Yet if we were to thoroughly investigate we may find some of these ideas are not in the Bible at all while others are contradicted by it.
